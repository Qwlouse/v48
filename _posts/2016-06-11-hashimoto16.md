title: Learning Population-Level Diffusions with Generative RNNs
abstract: We estimate stochastic processes that govern the dynamics of evolving populations
  such as cell differentiation. The problem is challenging since longitudinal trajectory
  measurements of individuals in a population are rarely available due to experimental
  cost and/or privacy. We show that cross-sectional samples from an evolving population
  suffice for recovery within a class of processes even if samples are available only
  at a few distinct time points. We provide a stratified analysis of recoverability
  conditions, and establish that reversibility is sufficient for recoverability. For
  estimation, we derive a natural loss and regularization, and parameterize the processes
  as diffusive recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate the approach in the context
  of uncovering complex cellular dynamics known as the ‘epigenetic landscape’ from
  existing biological assays.
