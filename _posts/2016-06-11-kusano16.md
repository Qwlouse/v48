title: Persistence weighted Gaussian kernel for topological data analysis
abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging mathematical concept for
  characterizing shapes in complex data. In TDA, persistence diagrams are widely recognized
  as a useful descriptor of data, and can distinguish robust and noisy topological
  properties. This paper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams to develop
  a statistical framework in TDA. The proposed kernel satisfies the stability property
  and provides explicit control on the effect of persistence. Furthermore, the method
  allows a fast approximation technique. The method is applied into practical data
  on proteins and oxide glasses, and the results show the advantage of our method
  compared to other relevant methods on persistence diagrams.
