title: 'No Oops, You Wonâ€™t Do It Again: Mechanisms for Self-correction in Crowdsourcing'
abstract: Crowdsourcing is a very popular means of obtaining the large amounts of
  labeled data that modern machine learning methods require. Although cheap and fast
  to obtain, crowdsourced labels suffer from significant amounts of error, thereby
  degrading the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. With the goal of
  improving the quality of the labeled data, we seek to mitigate the many errors that
  occur due to silly mistakes or inadvertent errors by crowdsourcing workers. We propose
  a two-stage setting for crowdsourcing where the worker first answers the questions,
  and is then allowed to change her answers after looking at a (noisy) reference answer.
  We mathematically formulate this process and develop mechanisms to incentivize workers
  to act appropriately. Our mathematical guarantees show that our mechanism incentivizes
  the workers to answer honestly in both stages, and refrain from answering randomly
  in the first stage or simply copying in the second. Numerical experiments reveal
  a significant boost in performance that such "self-correction" can provide when
  using crowdsourcing to train machine learning algorithms.
