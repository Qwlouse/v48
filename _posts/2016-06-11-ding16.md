title: K-Means Clustering with Distributed Dimensions
abstract: Distributed clustering has attracted significant attention in recent years.
  In this paper, we study the k-means problem in the distributed dimension setting,
  where the dimensions of the data are partitioned across multiple machines. We provide
  new approximation algorithms, which incur low communication costs and achieve constant
  approximation ratios. The communication complexity of our algorithms significantly
  improve on existing algorithms. We also provide the first communication lower bound,
  which nearly matches our upper bound in a certain range of parameter setting. Our
  experimental results show that our algorithms outperform existing algorithms on
  real data-sets in the distributed dimension setting.
