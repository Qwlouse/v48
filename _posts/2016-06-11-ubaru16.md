title: Fast methods for estimating the Numerical rank of large matrices
abstract: We present two computationally inexpensive techniques for estimating the
  numerical rank of a matrix, combining powerful tools from computational linear algebra.
  These techniques exploit three key ingredients. The first is to approximate the
  projector on the non-null invariant subspace of the matrix by using a polynomial
  filter. Two types of filters are discussed, one based on Hermite interpolation and
  the other based on Chebyshev expansions. The second ingredient employs stochastic
  trace estimators to compute the rank of this wanted eigen-projector, which yields
  the desired rank of the matrix. In order to obtain a good filter, it is necessary
  to detect a gap between the eigenvalues that correspond to noise and the relevant
  eigenvalues that correspond to the non-null invariant subspace. The third ingredient
  of the proposed approaches exploits the idea of spectral density, popular in physics,
  and the Lanczos spectroscopic method to locate this gap.
