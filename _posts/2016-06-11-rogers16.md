title: 'Differentially Private Chi-Squared Hypothesis Testing: Goodness of Fit and
  Independence Testing'
abstract: Hypothesis testing is a useful statistical tool in determining whether a
  given model should be rejected based on a sample from the population. Sample data
  may contain sensitive information about individuals, such as medical information.
  Thus it is important to design statistical tests that guarantee the privacy of subjects
  in the data. In this work, we study hypothesis testing subject to differential privacy,
  specifically chi-squared tests for goodness of fit for multinomial data and independence
  between two categorical variables.
