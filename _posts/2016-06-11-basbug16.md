title: Hierarchical Compound Poisson Factorization
abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization models based on a hierarchical Gamma-Poisson
  structure capture user and item behavior effectively in extremely sparse data sets,
  making them the ideal choice for collaborative filtering applications. Hierarchical
  Poisson factorization (HPF) in particular has proved successful for scalable recommendation
  systems with extreme sparsity. HPF, however, suffers from a tight coupling of sparsity
  model (absence of a rating) and response model (the value of the rating), which
  limits the expressiveness of the latter. Here, we introduce hierarchical compound
  Poisson factorization (HCPF) that has the favorable Gamma-Poisson structure and
  scalability of HPF to high-dimensional extremely sparse matrices. More importantly,
  HCPF decouples the sparsity model from the response model, allowing us to choose
  the most suitable distribution for the response. HCPF can capture binary, non-negative
  discrete, non-negative continuous, and zero-inflated continuous responses. We compare
  HCPF with HPF on nine discrete and three continuous data sets and conclude that
  HCPF captures the relationship between sparsity and response better than HPF.
