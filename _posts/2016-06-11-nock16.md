title: 'k-variates++: more pluses in the k-means++'
abstract: k-means++ seeding has become a de facto standard for hard clustering algorithms.
  In this paper, our first contribution is a two-way generalisation of this seeding,
  k-variates++, that includes the sampling of general densities rather than just a
  discrete set of Dirac densities anchored at the point locations, \textitand a generalisation
  of the well known Arthur-Vassilvitskii (AV) approximation guarantee, in the form
  of a \textitbias+variance approximation bound of the \textitglobal optimum. This
  approximation exhibits a reduced dependency on the "noise" component with respect
  to the optimal potential — actually approaching the statistical lower bound. We
  show that k-variates++ \textitreduces to efficient (biased seeding) clustering algorithms
  tailored to specific frameworks; these include distributed, streaming and on-line
  clustering, with \textitdirect approximation results for these algorithms. Finally,
  we present a novel application of k-variates++ to differential privacy. For either
  the specific frameworks considered here, or for the differential privacy setting,
  there is little to no prior results on the direct application of k-means++ and its
  approximation bounds — state of the art contenders appear to be significantly more
  complex and / or display less favorable (approximation) properties. We stress that
  our algorithms can still be run in cases where there is \textitno closed form solution
  for the population minimizer. We demonstrate the applicability of our analysis via
  experimental evaluation on several domains and settings, displaying competitive
  performances vs state of the art.
