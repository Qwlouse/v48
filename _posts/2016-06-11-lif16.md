title: Contextual Combinatorial Cascading Bandits
abstract: We propose the contextual combinatorial cascading bandits, a combinatorial
  online learning game, where at each time step a learning agent is given a set of
  contextual information, then selects a list of items, and observes stochastic outcomes
  of a prefix in the selected items by some stopping criterion. In online recommendation,
  the stopping criterion might be the first item a user selects; in network routing,
  the stopping criterion might be the first edge blocked in a path. We consider position
  discounts in the list order, so that the agentâ€™s reward is discounted depending
  on the position where the stopping criterion is met. We design a UCB-type algorithm,
  C^3-UCB, for this problem, prove an n-step regret bound \tildeO(\sqrtn) in the general
  setting, and give finer analysis for two special cases. Our work generalizes existing
  studies in several directions, including contextual information, position discounts,
  and a more general cascading bandit model. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
  demonstrate the advantage of involving contextual information and position discounts.
