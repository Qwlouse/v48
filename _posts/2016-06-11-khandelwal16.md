title: On the Analysis of Complex Backup Strategies in Monte Carlo Tree Search
abstract: Over the past decade, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and specifically Upper
  Confidence Bound in Trees (UCT) have proven to be quite effective in large probabilistic
  planning domains. In this paper, we focus on how values are backpropagated in the
  MCTS tree, and apply complex return strategies from the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  literature to MCTS, producing 4 new MCTS variants. We demonstrate that in some probabilistic
  planning benchmarks from the International Planning Competition (IPC), selecting
  a MCTS variant with a backup strategy different from Monte Carlo averaging can lead
  to substantially better results. We also propose a hypothesis for why different
  backup strategies lead to different performance in particular environments, and
  manipulate a carefully structured grid-world domain to provide empirical evidence
  supporting our hypothesis.
