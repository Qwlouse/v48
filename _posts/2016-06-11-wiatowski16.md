title: 'Discrete Deep Feature Extraction: A Theory and New Architectures'
abstract: First steps towards a mathematical theory of deep convolutional neural networks
  for feature extraction were made—for the continuous-time case—in Mallat, 2012, and
  Wiatowski and Bölcskei, 2015. This paper considers the discrete case, introduces
  new convolutional neural network architectures, and proposes a mathematical framework
  for their analysis. Specifically, we establish deformation and translation sensitivity
  results of local and global nature, and we investigate how certain structural properties
  of the input signal are reflected in the corresponding feature vectors. Our theory
  applies to general filters and general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities and
  pooling operators. Experiments on handwritten digit classification and facial landmark
  detection—including feature importance evaluation—complement the theoretical findings.
