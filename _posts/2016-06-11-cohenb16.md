title: Convolutional Rectifier Networks as Generalized Tensor Decompositions
abstract: Convolutional rectifier networks, i.e. convolutional neural networks with
  rectified linear activation and max or average pooling, are the cornerstone of modern
  deep learning. However, despite their wide use and success, our theoretical understanding
  of the expressive properties that drive these networks is partial at best. On the
  other hand, we have a much firmer grasp of these issues in the world of arithmetic
  circuits. Specifically, it is known that convolutional arithmetic circuits possess
  the property of "complete depth efficiency", meaning that besides a negligible set,
  all functions realizable by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential
  size in order to be realized (or approximated) by a shallow network. In this paper
  we describe a construction based on generalized tensor decompositions, that transforms
  convolutional arithmetic circuits into convolutional rectifier networks. We then
  use mathematical tools available from the world of arithmetic circuits to prove
  new results. First, we show that convolutional rectifier networks are universal
  with max pooling but not with average pooling. Second, and more importantly, we
  show that depth efficiency is weaker with convolutional rectifier networks than
  it is with convolutional arithmetic circuits. This leads us to believe that developing
  effective methods for training convolutional arithmetic circuits, thereby fulfilling
  their expressive potential, may give rise to a deep learning architecture that is
  provably superior to convolutional rectifier networks but has so far been overlooked
  by practitioners.
