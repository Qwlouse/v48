title: An optimal algorithm for the Thresholding Bandit Problem
abstract: We study a specific combinatorial pure exploration stochastic bandit problem
  where the learner aims at finding the set of arms whose means are above a given
  threshold, up to a given precision, and for a fixed time horizon. We propose a parameter-free
  algorithm based on an original heuristic, and prove that it is optimal for this
  problem by deriving matching upper and lower bounds. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first non-trivial pure exploration setting with fixed budget for which
  provably optimal strategies are constructed.
