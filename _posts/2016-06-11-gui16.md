title: Towards Faster Rates and Oracle Property for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation
abstract: We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with a nonconvex
  penalty. A proximal gradient homotopy algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed
  optimization problem. Theoretically, we first prove that the proposed estimator
  attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator
  with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition
  on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle
  property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining
  a faster rate. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world
  datasets corroborate our theoretical findings.
