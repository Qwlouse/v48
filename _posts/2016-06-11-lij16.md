title: Conditional Bernoulli Mixtures for Multi-label Classification
abstract: 'Multi-label classification is an important machine learning task wherein
  one assigns a subset of candidate labels to an object. In this paper, we propose
  a new multi-label classification method based on Conditional Bernoulli Mixtures.
  Our proposed method has several attractive properties: it captures label dependencies;
  it reduces the multi-label problem to several standard binary and multi-class problems;
  it subsumes the classic independent binary prediction and power-set subset prediction
  methods as special cases; and it exhibits accuracy and/or computational complexity
  advantages over existing approaches. We demonstrate two implementations of our method
  using logistic regressions and gradient boosted trees, together with a simple training
  procedure based on Expectation Maximization. We further derive an efficient prediction
  procedure based on dynamic programming, thus avoiding the cost of examining an exponential
  number of potential label subsets. Experimental results show the effectiveness of
  the proposed method against competitive alternatives on benchmark datasets.'
