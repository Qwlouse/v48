title: Nonlinear Statistical Learning with Truncated Gaussian Graphical Models
abstract: We introduce the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM) as a novel framework
  for designing statistical models for nonlinear learning. A TGGM is a Gaussian graphical
  model (GGM) with a subset of variables truncated to be nonnegative. The truncated
  variables are assumed latent and integrated out to induce a marginal model. We show
  that the variables in the marginal model are non-Gaussian distributed and their
  expected relations are nonlinear. We use expectation-maximization to break the inference
  of the nonlinear model into a sequence of TGGM inference problems, each of which
  is efficiently solved by using the properties and numerical methods of multivariate
  Gaussian distributions. We use the TGGM to design models for nonlinear regression
  and classification, with the performances of these models demonstrated on extensive
  benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competing results.
