title: Variance-Reduced and Projection-Free Stochastic Optimization
abstract: The Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm has recently regained popularity
  for machine learning applications due to its projection-free property and its ability
  to handle structured constraints. However, in the stochastic learning setting, it
  is still relatively understudied compared to the gradient descent counterpart. In
  this work, leveraging a recent variance reduction technique, we propose two stochastic
  Frank-Wolfe variants which substantially improve previous results in terms of the
  number of stochastic gradient evaluations needed to achieve 1-εaccuracy. For example,
  we improve from O(\frac1ε) to O(\ln\frac1ε) if the objective function is smooth
  and strongly convex, and from O(\frac1ε^2) to O(\frac1ε^1.5) if the objective function
  is smooth and Lipschitz. The theoretical improvement is also observed in experiments
  on real-world datasets for a multiclass classification application.
