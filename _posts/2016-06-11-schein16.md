title: Bayesian Poisson Tucker Decomposition for Learning the Structure of International
  Relations
abstract: We introduce Bayesian Poisson Tucker decomposition (BPTD) for modeling country–country
  interaction event data. These data consist of interaction events of the form “country
  i took action a toward country j at time t.” BPTD discovers overlapping country–community
  memberships, including the number of latent communities. In addition, it discovers
  directed community–community interaction networks that are specific to “topics”
  of action types and temporal “regimes.” We show that BPTD yields an efficient MCMC
  inference algorithm and achieves better predictive performance than related models.
  We also demonstrate that it discovers interpretable latent structure that agrees
  with our knowledge of international relations.
