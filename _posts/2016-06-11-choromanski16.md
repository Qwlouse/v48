title: Recycling Randomness with Structure for Sublinear time Kernel Expansions
abstract: We propose a scheme for recycling Gaussian random vectors into structured
  matrices to ap- proximate various kernel functions in sublin- ear time via random
  embeddings. Our frame- work includes the Fastfood construction of Le et al. (2013)
  as a special case, but also ex- tends to Circulant, Toeplitz and Hankel matri- ces,
  and the broader family of structured matri- ces that are characterized by the concept
  of low- displacement rank. We introduce notions of co- herence and graph-theoretic
  structural constants that control the approximation quality, and prove unbiasedness
  and low-variance properties of ran- dom feature maps that arise within our frame-
  work. For the case of low-displacement matri- ces, we show how the degree of structure
  and randomness can be controlled to reduce statis- tical variance at the cost of
  increased computa- tion and storage requirements. Empirical results strongly support
  our theory and justify the use of a broader family of structured matrices for scal-
  ing up kernel methods using random features.
