title: Extended and Unscented Kitchen Sinks
abstract: We propose a scalable multiple-output generalization of unscented and extended
  Gaussian processes. These algorithms have been designed to handle general likelihood
  models by linearizing them using a Taylor series or the Unscented Transform in a
  variational inference framework. We build upon random feature approximations of
  Gaussian process covariance functions and show that, on small-scale single-task
  problems, our methods can attain similar performance as the original algorithms
  while having less computational cost. We also evaluate our methods at a larger scale
  on MNIST and on a seismic inversion which is inherently a multi-task problem.
