title: A Kronecker-factored approximate Fisher matrix for convolution layers
abstract: Second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient descent have
  the potential to speed up training of neural networks by correcting for the curvature
  of the loss function. Unfortunately, the exact natural gradient is impractical to
  compute for large models, and most approximations either require an expensive iterative
  procedure or make crude approximations to the curvature. We present Kronecker Factors
  for Convolution (KFC), a tractable approximation to the Fisher matrix for convolutional
  networks based on a structured probabilistic model for the distribution over backpropagated
  derivatives. Similarly to the recently proposed Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature
  (K-FAC), each block of the approximate Fisher matrix decomposes as the Kronecker
  product of small matrices, allowing for efficient inversion. KFC captures important
  curvature information while still yielding comparably efficient updates to stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD). We show that the updates are invariant to commonly used
  reparameterizations, such as centering of the activations. In our experiments, approximate
  natural gradient descent with KFC was able to train convolutional networks several
  times faster than carefully tuned SGD. Furthermore, it was able to train the networks
  in 10-20 times fewer iterations than SGD, suggesting its potential applicability
  in a distributed setting.
