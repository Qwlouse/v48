title: 'Dealbreaker: A Nonlinear Latent Variable Model for Educational Data'
abstract: Statistical models of student responses on assessment questions, such as
  those in homeworks and exams, enable educators and computer-based personalized learning
  systems to gain insights into students’ knowledge using machine learning. Popular
  student-response models, including the Rasch model and item response theory models,
  represent the probability of a student answering a question correctly using an affine
  function of latent factors. While such models can accurately predict student responses,
  their ability to interpret the underlying knowledge structure (which is certainly
  nonlinear) is limited. In response, we develop a new, nonlinear latent variable
  model that we call the dealbreaker model, in which a student’s success probability
  is determined by their weakest concept mastery. We develop efficient parameter inference
  algorithms for this model using novel methods for nonconvex optimization. We show
  that the dealbreaker model achieves comparable or better prediction performance
  as compared to affine models with real-world educational datasets. We further demonstrate
  that the parameters learned by the dealbreaker model are interpretable—they provide
  key insights into which concepts are critical (i.e., the “dealbreaker”) to answering
  a question correctly. We conclude by reporting preliminary results for a movie-rating
  dataset, which illustrate the broader applicability of the dealbreaker model.
