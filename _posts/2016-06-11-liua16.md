title: The Teaching Dimension of Linear Learners
abstract: Teaching dimension is a learning theoretic quantity that specifies the minimum
  training set size to teach a target model to a learner. Previous studies on teaching
  dimension focused on version-space learners which maintain all hypotheses consistent
  with the training data, and cannot be applied to modern machine learners which select
  a specific hypothesis via optimization. This paper presents the first known teaching
  dimension for ridge regression, support vector machines, and logistic regression.
  We also exhibit optimal training sets that match these teaching dimensions. Our
  approach generalizes to other linear learners.
