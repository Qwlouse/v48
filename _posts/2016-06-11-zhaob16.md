title: Learning Mixtures of Plackett-Luce Models
abstract: In this paper we address the identifiability and efficient learning problems
  of finite mixtures of Plackett-Luce models for rank data. We prove that for any
  k≥2, the mixture of k Plackett-Luce models for no more than 2k-1 alternatives is
  non-identifiable and this bound is tight for k=2. For generic identifiability, we
  prove that the mixture of k Plackett-Luce models over m alternatives is \em generically
  identifiable if k≤⌊\frac m-2 2⌋!. We also propose an efficient generalized method
  of moments (GMM) algorithm to learn the mixture of two Plackett-Luce models and
  show that the algorithm is consistent. Our experiments show that our GMM algorithm
  is significantly faster than the EMM algorithm by Gormley & Murphy (2008), while
  achieving competitive statistical efficiency.
