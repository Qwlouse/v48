title: Deep Gaussian Processes for Regression using Approximate Expectation Propagation
abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations
  of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with
  multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are nonparametric probabilistic models
  and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise, and
  provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models. This
  paper develops a new approximate Bayesian learning scheme that enables DGPs to be
  applied to a range of medium to large scale regression problems for the first time.
  The new method uses an approximate Expectation Propagation procedure and a novel
  and efficient extension of the probabilistic backpropagation algorithm for learning.
  We evaluate the new method for non-linear regression on eleven real-world datasets,
  showing that it always outperforms GP regression and is almost always better than
  state-of-the-art deterministic and sampling-based approximate inference methods
  for Bayesian neural networks. As a by-product, this work provides a comprehensive
  analysis of six approximate Bayesian methods for training neural networks.
