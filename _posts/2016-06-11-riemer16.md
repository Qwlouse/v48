title: Correcting Forecasts with Multifactor Neural Attention
abstract: Automatic forecasting of time series data is a challenging problem in many
  industries. Current forecast models adopted by businesses do not provide adequate
  means for including data representing external factors that may have a significant
  impact on the time series, such as weather, national events, local events, social
  media trends, promotions, etc. This paper introduces a novel neural network attention
  mechanism that naturally incorporates data from multiple external sources without
  the feature engineering needed to get other techniques to work. We demonstrate empirically
  that the proposed model achieves superior performance for predicting the demand
  of 20 commodities across 107 stores of one of Americaâ€™s largest retailers when compared
  to other baseline models, including neural networks, linear models, certain kernel
  methods, Bayesian regression, and decision trees. Our method ultimately accounts
  for a 23.9% relative improvement as a result of the incorporation of external data
  sources, and provides an unprecedented level of descriptive ability for a neural
  network forecasting model.
