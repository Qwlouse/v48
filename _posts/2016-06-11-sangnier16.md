title: Early and Reliable Event Detection Using Proximity Space Representation
abstract: Let us consider a specific action or situation (called event) that takes
  place within a time series. The objective in early detection is to build a decision
  function that is able to go off as soon as possible from the onset of an occurrence
  of this event. This implies making a decision with an incomplete information. This
  paper proposes a novel framework that i) guarantees that a detection made with a
  partial observation will also occur at full observation of the time-series; ii)
  incorporates in a consistent manner the lack of knowledge about the minimal amount
  of information needed to make a decision. The proposed detector is based on mapping
  the temporal sequences to a landmarking space thanks to appropriately designed similarity
  functions. As a by-product, the framework benefits from a scalable training algorithm
  and a theoretical guarantee concerning its generalization ability. We also discuss
  an important improvement of our framework in which decision function can still be
  made reliable while being more expressive. Our experimental studies provide compelling
  results on toy data, presenting the trade-off that occurs when aiming at accuracy,
  earliness and reliability. Results on real physiological and video datasets show
  that our proposed approach is as accurate and early as state-of-the-art algorithm,
  while ensuring reliability and being far more efficient to learn.
