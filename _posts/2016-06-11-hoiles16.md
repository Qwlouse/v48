title: Bounded Off-Policy Evaluation with Missing Data for Course Recommendation and
  Curriculum Design
abstract: Successfully recommending personalized course schedules is a difficult problem
  given the diversity of students knowledge, learning behaviour, and goals. This paper
  presents personalized course recommendation and curriculum design algorithms that
  exploit logged student data. The algorithms are based on the regression estimator
  for contextual multi-armed bandits with a penalized variance term. Guarantees on
  the predictive performance of the algorithms are provided using empirical Bernstein
  bounds. We also provide guidelines for including expert domain knowledge into the
  recommendations. Using undergraduate engineering logged data from a post-secondary
  institution we illustrate the performance of these algorithms.
