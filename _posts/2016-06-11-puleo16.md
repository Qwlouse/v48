title: Correlation Clustering and Biclustering with Locally Bounded Errors
abstract: 'We consider a generalized version of the correlation clustering problem,
  defined as follows. Given a complete graph G whose edges are labeled with + or -,
  we wish to partition the graph into clusters while trying to avoid errors: + edges
  between clusters or - edges within clusters. Classically, one seeks to minimize
  the total number of such errors. We introduce a new framework that allows the objective
  to be a more general function of the number of errors at each vertex (for example,
  we may wish to minimize the number of errors at the worst vertex) and provide a
  rounding algorithm which converts “fractional clusterings” into discrete clusterings
  while causing only a constant-factor blowup in the number of errors at each vertex.
  This rounding algorithm yields constant-factor approximation algorithms for the
  discrete problem under a wide variety of objective functions.'
