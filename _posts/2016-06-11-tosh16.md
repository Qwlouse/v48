title: Mixing Rates for the Alternating Gibbs Sampler over Restricted Boltzmann Machines
  and Friends
abstract: Alternating Gibbs sampling is a modification of classical Gibbs sampling
  where several variables are simultaneously sampled from their joint conditional
  distribution. In this work, we investigate the mixing rate of alternating Gibbs
  sampling with a particular emphasis on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and
  variants.
