title: Asymmetric Multi-task Learning Based on Task Relatedness and Loss
abstract: We propose a novel multi-task learning method that can minimize the effect
  of negative transfer by allowing asymmetric transfer between the tasks based on
  task relatedness as well as the amount of individual task losses, which we refer
  to as Asymmetric Multi-task Learning (AMTL). To tackle this problem, we couple multiple
  tasks via a sparse, directed regularization graph, that enforces each task parameter
  to be reconstructed as a sparse combination of other tasks, which are selected based
  on the task-wise loss. We present two different algorithms to solve this joint learning
  of the task predictors and the regularization graph. The first algorithm solves
  for the original learning objective using alternative optimization, and the second
  algorithm solves an approximation of it using curriculum learning strategy, that
  learns one task at a time. We perform experiments on multiple datasets for classification
  and regression, on which we obtain significant improvements in performance over
  the single task learning and symmetric multitask learning baselines.
