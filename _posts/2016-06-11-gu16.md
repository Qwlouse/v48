title: Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-based Acceleration
abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range
  of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural network
  policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of model-free algorithms,
  particularly when using high-dimensional function approximators, tends to limit
  their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and
  representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for
  continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving
  the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the
  Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized advantage functions (NAF), as an
  alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods.
  NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous
  tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control
  tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of
  learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that
  iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and
  demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.
