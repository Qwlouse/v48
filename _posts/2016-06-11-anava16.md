title: 'Heteroscedastic Sequences: Beyond Gaussianity'
abstract: We address the problem of sequential prediction in the heteroscedastic setting,
  when both the signal and its variance are assumed to depend on explanatory variables.
  By applying regret minimization techniques, we devise an efficient online learning
  algorithm for the problem, without assuming that the error terms comply with a specific
  distribution. We show that our algorithm can be adjusted to provide confidence bounds
  for its predictions, and provide an application to ARCH models. The theoretic results
  are corroborated by an empirical study.
