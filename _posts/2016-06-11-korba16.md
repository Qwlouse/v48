title: Controlling the distance to a Kemeny consensus without computing it
abstract: 'Due to its numerous applications, rank aggregation has become a problem
  of major interest across many fields of the computer science literature. In the
  vast majority of situations, Kemeny consensus(es) are considered as the ideal solutions.
  It is however well known that their computation is NP-hard. Many contributions have
  thus established various results to apprehend this complexity. In this paper we
  introduce a practical method to predict, for a ranking and a dataset, how close
  the Kemeny consensus(es) are to this ranking. A major strength of this method is
  its generality: it does not require any assumption on the dataset nor the ranking.
  Furthermore, it relies on a new geometric interpretation of Kemeny aggregation that,
  we believe, could lead to many other results.'
