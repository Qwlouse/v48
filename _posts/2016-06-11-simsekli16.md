title: Stochastic Quasi-Newton Langevin Monte Carlo
abstract: Recently, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods
  have been proposed for scaling up Monte Carlo computations to large data problems.
  Whilst these approaches have proven useful in many applications, vanilla SG-MCMC
  might suffer from poor mixing rates when random variables exhibit strong couplings
  under the target densities or big scale differences. In this study, we propose a
  novel SG-MCMC method that takes the local geometry into account by using ideas from
  Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These second order methods directly approximate
  the inverse Hessian by using a limited history of samples and their gradients. Our
  method uses dense approximations of the inverse Hessian while keeping the time and
  memory complexities linear with the dimension of the problem. We provide a formal
  theoretical analysis where we show that the proposed method is asymptotically unbiased
  and consistent with the posterior expectations. We illustrate the effectiveness
  of the approach on both synthetic and real datasets. Our experiments on two challenging
  applications show that our method achieves fast convergence rates similar to Riemannian
  approaches while at the same time having low computational requirements similar
  to diagonal preconditioning approaches.
