title: 'Fast Stochastic Algorithms for SVD and PCA: Convergence Properties and Convexity'
abstract: We study the convergence properties of the VR-PCA algorithm introduced by
  (Shamir, 2015) for fast computation of leading singular vectors. We prove several
  new results, including a formal analysis of a block version of the algorithm, and
  convergence from random initialization. We also make a few observations of independent
  interest, such as how pre-initializing with just a single exact power iteration
  can significantly improve the analysis, and what are the convexity and non-convexity
  properties of the underlying optimization problem.
