title: On the Power and Limits of Distance-Based Learning
abstract: We initiate the study of low-distortion finite metric embeddings in multi-class
  (and multi-label) classification where (i) both the space of input instances and
  the space of output classes have combinatorial metric structure and (ii) the concepts
  we wish to learn are low-distortion embeddings. We develop new geometric techniques
  and prove strong learning lower bounds. These provable limits hold even when we
  allow learners and classifiers to get advice by one or more experts. Our study overwhelmingly
  indicates that post-geometry assumptions are necessary in multi-class classification,
  as in natural language processing (NLP). Technically, the mathematical tools we
  developed in this work could be of independent interest to NLP. To the best of our
  knowledge, this is the first work which formally studies classification problems
  in combinatorial spaces. and where the concepts are low-distortion embeddings.
