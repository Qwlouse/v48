title: Auxiliary Deep Generative Models
abstract: Deep generative models parameterized by neural networks have recently achieved
  state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We extend
  deep generative models with auxiliary variables which improves the variational approximation.
  The auxiliary variables leave the generative model unchanged but make the variational
  distribution more expressive. Inspired by the structure of the auxiliary variable
  we also propose a model with two stochastic layers and skip connections. Our findings
  suggest that more expressive and properly specified deep generative models converge
  faster with better results. We show state-of-the-art performance within semi-supervised
  learning on MNIST, SVHN and NORB datasets.
