title: A Distributed Variational Inference Framework for Unifying Parallel Sparse
  Gaussian Process Regression Models
abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed variational inference framework
  that unifies many parallel sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) models for
  scalable hyperparameter learning with big data. To achieve this, our framework exploits
  a structure of correlated noise process model that represents the observation noises
  as a finite realization of a high-order Gaussian Markov random process. By varying
  the Markov order and covariance function for the noise process model, different
  variational SGPR models result. This consequently allows the correlation structure
  of the noise process model to be characterized for which a particular variational
  SGPR model is optimal. We empirically evaluate the predictive performance and scalability
  of the distributed variational SGPR models unified by our framework on two real-world
  datasets.
