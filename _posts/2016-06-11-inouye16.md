title: 'Square Root Graphical Models: Multivariate Generalizations of Univariate Exponential
  Families that Permit Positive Dependencies'
abstract: We develop Square Root Graphical Models (SQR), a novel class of parametric
  graphical models that provides multivariate generalizations of univariate exponential
  family distributions. Previous multivariate graphical models [Yang et al. 2015]
  did not allow positive dependencies for the exponential and Poisson generalizations.
  However, in many real-world datasets, variables clearly have positive dependencies.
  For example, the airport delay time in New York—modeled as an exponential distribution—is
  positively related to the delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an
  example of our model class derived from the univariate exponential distribution
  that allows for almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a
  mild condition on the parameter matrix—a condition akin to the positive definiteness
  of the Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive
  and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We also
  develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with \ell_1 regularization
  and likelihood approximation methods using sampling. Finally, we demonstrate our
  exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of airport
  delay times.
