title: Faster Eigenvector Computation via Shift-and-Invert Preconditioning
abstract: We give faster algorithms and improved sample complexities for the fundamental
  problem of estimating the top eigenvector. Given an explicit matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
  \times d}$, we show how to compute an Îµapproximate top eigenvector of $A^TA$ in time
  $\tilde O( [\text{nnz}(A) + \frac{d \text{sr}(A)}{\text{gap}^2} ] \cdot \log 1/\epsilon)$. Here $nnz(A)$ is the number of
  nonzeros in $A$, $sr(A)$ is the stable rank, and gap is the relative eigengap. We also
  consider an online setting in which, given a stream of i.i.d. samples from a distribution
  D with covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and a vector $x_0$ which is an $O(gap)$ approximate top eigenvector
  for $\Sigma$, we show how to refine $x_0$ to an $\epsilon$ approximation using  $O ( \frac{\text{var}(\mathcal{D})}{\text{gap}-\epsilon}) samples from $\mathcal{D}$. Here $\text{var}(\mathcal{D})$ is a natural notion of variance. Combining our
  algorithm with previous work to initialize $x_0$, we obtain improved sample complexities
  and runtimes under a variety of assumptions on D. We achieve our results via a robust
  analysis of the classic shift-and-invert preconditioning method. This technique
  lets us reduce eigenvector computation to *approximately* solving a series of linear
  systems with fast stochastic gradient methods.
