title: Tensor Decomposition via Joint Matrix Schur Decomposition
abstract: We describe an approach to tensor decomposition that involves extracting
  a set of observable matrices from the tensor and applying an approximate joint Schur
  decomposition on those matrices, and we establish the corresponding first-order
  perturbation bounds. We develop a novel iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm for joint
  matrix Schur decomposition, which minimizes a nonconvex objective over the manifold
  of orthogonal matrices, and which is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum
  under certain conditions. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm is faster
  and at least as accurate and robust than state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem.
