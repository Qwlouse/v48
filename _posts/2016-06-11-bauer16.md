title: The Arrow of Time in Multivariate Time Series
abstract: We prove that a time series satisfying a (linear) multivariate autoregressive
  moving average (VARMA) model satisfies the same model assumption in the reversed
  time direction, too, if all innovations are normally distributed. This reversibility
  breaks down if the innovations are non-Gaussian. This means that under the assumption
  of a VARMA process with non-Gaussian noise, the arrow of time becomes detectable.
  Our work thereby provides a theoretic justification of an algorithm that has been
  used for inferring the direction of video snippets. We present a slightly modified
  practical algorithm that estimates the time direction for a given sample and prove
  its consistency. We further investigate how the performance of the algorithm depends
  on sample size, number of dimensions of the time series and the order of the process.
  An application to real world data from economics shows that considering multivariate
  processes instead of univariate processes can be beneficial for estimating the time
  direction. Our result extends earlier work on univariate time series. It relates
  to the concept of causal inference, where recent methods exploit non-Gaussianity
  of the error terms for causal structure learning.
