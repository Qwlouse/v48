title: Exact Exponent in Optimal Rates for Crowdsourcing
abstract: Crowdsourcing has become a popular tool for labeling large datasets. This
  paper studies the optimal error rate for aggregating crowdsourced labels provided
  by a collection of amateur workers. Under the Dawid-Skene probabilistic model, we
  establish matching upper and lower bounds with an exact exponent mI(\pi), where
  m is the number of workers and I(\pi) is the average Chernoff information that characterizes
  the workers’ collective ability. Such an exact characterization of the error exponent
  allows us to state a precise sample size requirement m \ge \frac1I(\pi)\log\frac1ε
  in order to achieve an εmisclassification error. In addition, our results imply
  optimality of various forms of EM algorithms given accurate initializers of the
  model parameters.
