title: Collapsed Variational Inference for Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
  exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing parameter learning
  approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum likelihood principle and are
  subject to overfitting compared to more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior
  inference for SPNs is computationally intractable. Even approximation techniques
  such as standard variational inference and posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally
  infeasible even for networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
  variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic collapsed
  variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is computationally efficient, easy
  to implement and at the same time allows us to incorporate prior information into
  the optimization formulation. Extensive experiments show a significant improvement
  in accuracy compared with a maximum likelihood based approach.
