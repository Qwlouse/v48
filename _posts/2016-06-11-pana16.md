title: Markov-modulated Marked Poisson Processes for Check-in Data
abstract: We develop continuous-time probabilistic models to study trajectory data
  consisting of times and locations of user “check-ins”. We model the data as realizations
  of a marked point process, with intensity and mark-distribution modulated by a latent
  Markov jump process (MJP). We also include user-heterogeneity in our model by assigning
  each user a vector of “preferred locations”. Our model extends latent Dirichlet
  allocation by dropping the bag-of-words assumption and operating in continuous time.
  We show how an appropriate choice of priors allows efficient posterior inference.
  Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing with various
  baselines on a variety of tasks.
