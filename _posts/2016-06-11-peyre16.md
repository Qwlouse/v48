title: Gromov-Wasserstein Averaging of Kernel and Distance Matrices
abstract: This paper presents a new technique for computing the barycenter of a set
  of distance or kernel matrices. These matrices, which define the inter-relationships
  between points sampled from individual domains, are not required to have the same
  size or to be in row-by-row correspondence. We compare these matrices using the
  softassign criterion, which measures the minimum distortion induced by a probabilistic
  map from the rows of one similarity matrix to the rows of another; this criterion
  amounts to a regularized version of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between
  metric-measure spaces. The barycenter is then defined as a Fréchet mean of the input
  matrices with respect to this criterion, minimizing a weighted sum of softassign
  values. We provide a fast iterative algorithm for the resulting nonconvex optimization
  problem, built upon state-of- the-art tools for regularized optimal transportation.
  We demonstrate its application to the computation of shape barycenters and to the
  prediction of energy levels from molecular configurations in quantum chemistry.
