title: 'Copeland Dueling Bandit Problem: Regret Lower Bound, Optimal Algorithm, and
  Computationally Efficient Algorithm'
abstract: We study the K-armed dueling bandit problem, a variation of the standard
  stochastic bandit problem where the feedback is limited to relative comparisons
  of a pair of arms. The hardness of recommending Copeland winners, the arms that
  beat the greatest number of other arms, is characterized by deriving an asymptotic
  regret bound. We propose Copeland Winners Deterministic Minimum Empirical Divergence
  (CW-RMED), an algorithm inspired by the DMED algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010),
  and derive an asymptotically optimal regret bound for it. However, it is not known
  whether the algorithm can be efficiently computed or not. To address this issue,
  we devise an efficient version (ECW-RMED) and derive its asymptotic regret bound.
  Experimental comparisons of dueling bandit algorithms show that ECW-RMED significantly
  outperforms existing ones.
