title: Online Learning with Feedback Graphs Without the Graphs
abstract: We study an online learning framework introduced by Mannor and Shamir (2011)
  in which the feedback is specified by a graph, in a setting where the graph may
  vary from round to round and is \emphnever fully revealed to the learner. We show
  a large gap between the adversarial and the stochastic cases. In the adversarial
  case, we prove that even for dense feedback graphs, the learner cannot improve upon
  a trivial regret bound obtained by ignoring any additional feedback besides her
  own loss. In contrast, in the stochastic case we give an algorithm that achieves
  \widetildeΘ(\sqrtαT) regret over T rounds, provided that the independence numbers
  of the hidden feedback graphs are at most α. We also extend our results to a more
  general feedback model, in which the learner does not necessarily observe her own
  loss, and show that, even in simple cases, concealing the feedback graphs might
  render the problem unlearnable.
