title: 'Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing'
abstract: 'Most tasks in natural language processing can be cast into question answering
  (QA) problems over language input. We introduce the dynamic memory network (DMN),
  a neural network architecture which processes input sequences and questions, forms
  episodic memories, and generates relevant answers. Questions trigger an iterative
  attention process which allows the model to condition its attention on the inputs
  and the result of previous iterations. These results are then reasoned over in a
  hierarchical recurrent sequence model to generate answers. The DMN can be trained
  end-to-end and obtains state-of-the-art results on several types of tasks and datasets:
  question answering (Facebookâ€™s bAbI dataset), text classification for sentiment
  analysis (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and sequence modeling for part-of-speech
  tagging (WSJ-PTB). The training for these different tasks relies exclusively on
  trained word vector representations and input-question-answer triplets.'
