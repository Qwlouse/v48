title: Fast Parameter Inference in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using Iterative Gradient
  Matching
abstract: Parameter inference in mechanistic models of coupled differential equations
  is a topical and challenging problem. We propose a new method based on kernel ridge
  regression and gradient matching, and an objective function that simultaneously
  encourages goodness of fit and penalises inconsistencies with the differential equations.
  Fast minimisation is achieved by exploiting partial convexity inherent in this function,
  and setting up an iterative algorithm in the vein of the EM algorithm. An evaluation
  of the proposed method on various benchmark data suggests that it compares favourably
  with state-of-the-art alternatives.
