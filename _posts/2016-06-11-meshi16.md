title: Train and Test Tightness of LP Relaxations in Structured Prediction
abstract: Structured prediction is used in areas such as computer vision and natural
  language processing to predict structured outputs such as segmentations or parse
  trees. In these settings, prediction is performed by MAP inference or, equivalently,
  by solving an integer linear program. Because of the complex scoring functions required
  to obtain accurate predictions, both learning and inference typically require the
  use of approximate solvers. We propose a theoretical explanation to the striking
  observation that approximations based on linear programming (LP) relaxations are
  often tight on real-world instances. In particular, we show that learning with LP
  relaxed inference encourages integrality of training instances, and that tightness
  generalizes from train to test data.
