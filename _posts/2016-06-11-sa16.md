title: Ensuring Rapid Mixing and Low Bias for Asynchronous Gibbs Sampling
abstract: 'Gibbs sampling is a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique commonly used for
  estimating marginal distributions. To speed up Gibbs sampling, there has recently
  been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results
  suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional
  Markov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous
  Gibbs sampling is poorly understood. In this paper, we derive a better understanding
  of the two main challenges of asynchronous Gibbs: bias and mixing time. We show
  experimentally that our theoretical results match practical outcomes.'
