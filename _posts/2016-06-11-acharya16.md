title: Fast Algorithms for Segmented Regression
abstract: 'We study the fixed design segmented regression problem: Given noisy samples
  from a piecewise linear function f, we want to recover f up to a desired accuracy
  in mean-squared error. Previous rigorous approaches for this problem rely on dynamic
  programming (DP) and, while sample efficient, have running time quadratic in the
  sample size. As our main contribution, we provide new sample near-linear time algorithms
  for the problem that - while not being minimax optimal - achieve a significantly
  better sample-time tradeoff on large datasets compared to the DP approach. Our experimental
  evaluation shows that, compared with the DP approach, our algorithms provide a convergence
  rate that is only off by a factor of 2 to 4, while achieving speedups of three orders
  of magnitude.'
