title: Truthful Univariate Estimators
abstract: We revisit the classic problem of estimating the population mean of an unknown
  single-dimensional distribution from samples, taking a game-theoretic viewpoint.
  In our setting, samples are supplied by strategic agents, who wish to pull the estimate
  as close as possible to their own value. In this setting, the sample mean gives
  rise to manipulation opportunities, whereas the sample median does not. Our key
  question is whether the sample median is the best (in terms of mean squared error)
  truthful estimator of the population mean. We show that when the underlying distribution
  is symmetric, there are truthful estimators that dominate the median. Our main result
  is a characterization of worst-case optimal truthful estimators, which provably
  outperform the median, for possibly asymmetric distributions with bounded support.
