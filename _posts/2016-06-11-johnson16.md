title: Supervised and Semi-Supervised Text Categorization using LSTM for Region Embeddings
abstract: One-hot CNN (convolutional neural network) has been shown to be effective
  for text categorization (Johnson & Zhang, 2015). We view it as a special case of
  a general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature
  generator consisting of ‘text region embedding + pooling’. Under this framework,
  we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long Short-Term Memory
  (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly large) sizes, whereas
  the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek effective and efficient use
  of LSTM for this purpose in the supervised and semi-supervised settings. The best
  results were obtained by combining region embeddings in the form of LSTM and convolution
  layers trained on unlabeled data. The results indicate that on this task, embeddings
  of text regions, which can convey complex concepts, are more useful than embeddings
  of single words in isolation. We report performances exceeding the previous best
  results on four benchmark datasets.
