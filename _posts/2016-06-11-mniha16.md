title: Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We propose a conceptually simple and lightweight framework for deep reinforcement
  learning that uses asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural
  network controllers. We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement
  learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect
  on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers.
  The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the
  current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on
  a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous
  actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as
  well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.
