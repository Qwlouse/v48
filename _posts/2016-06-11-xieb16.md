title: Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis
abstract: Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and has been
  studied extensively in terms of distance functions and grouping algorithms. Relatively
  little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper,
  we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature
  representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a
  mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively
  optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text
  corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
