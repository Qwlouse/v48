title: Variational Inference for Monte Carlo Objectives
abstract: Recent progress in deep latent variable models has largely been driven by
  the development of flexible and scalable variational inference methods. Variational
  training of this type involves maximizing a lower bound on the log-likelihood, using
  samples from the variational posterior to compute the required gradients. Recently,
  Burda et al. (2016) have derived a tighter lower bound using a multi-sample importance
  sampling estimate of the likelihood and showed that optimizing it yields models
  that use more of their capacity and achieve higher likelihoods. This development
  showed the importance of such multi-sample objectives and explained the success
  of several related approaches. We extend the multi-sample approach to discrete latent
  variables and analyze the difficulty encountered when estimating the gradients involved.
  We then develop the first unbiased gradient estimator designed for importance-sampled
  objectives and evaluate it at training generative and structured output prediction
  models. The resulting estimator, which is based on low-variance per-sample learning
  signals, is both simpler and more effective than the NVIL estimator proposed for
  the single-sample variational objective, and is competitive with the currently used
  biased estimators.
