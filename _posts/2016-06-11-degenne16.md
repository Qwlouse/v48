title: Anytime optimal algorithms in stochastic multi-armed bandits
abstract: We introduce an anytime algorithm for stochastic multi-armed bandit with
  optimal distribution free and distribution dependent bounds (for a specific family
  of parameters). The performances of this algorithm (as well as another one motivated
  by the conjectured optimal bound) are evaluated empirically. A similar analysis
  is provided with full information, to serve as a benchmark.
