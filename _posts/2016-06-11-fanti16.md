title: Metadata-conscious anonymous messaging
abstract: Anonymous messaging platforms like Whisper and Yik Yak allow users to spread
  messages over a network (e.g., a social network) without revealing message authorship
  to other users. The spread of messages on these platforms can be modeled by a diffusion
  process over a graph. Recent advances in network analysis have revealed that such
  diffusion processes are vulnerable to author deanonymization by adversaries with
  access to metadata, such as timing information. In this work, we ask the fundamental
  question of how to propagate anonymous messages over a graph to make it difficult
  for adversaries to infer the source. In particular, we study the performance of
  a message propagation protocol called adaptive diffusion introduced in (Fanti et
  al., 2015). We prove that when the adversary has access to metadata at a fraction
  of corrupted graph nodes, adaptive diffusion achieves asymptotically optimal source-hiding
  and significantly outperforms standard diffusion. We further demonstrate empirically
  that adaptive diffusion hides the source effectively on real social networks.
