title: Binary embeddings with structured hashed projections
abstract: We consider the hashing mechanism for constructing binary embeddings, that
  involves pseudo-random projections followed by nonlinear (sign function) mappings.
  The pseudo-random projection is described by a matrix, where not all entries are
  independent random variables but instead a fixed “budget of randomness” is distributed
  across the matrix. Such matrices can be edfficiently stored in sub-quadratic or
  even linear space, provide reduction in randomness usage (i.e. number of required
  random values), and very often lead to computational speed ups. We prove several
  theoretical results showing that projections via various structured matrices followed
  by nonlinear mappings accurately preserve the angular distance between input high-dimensional
  vectors. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first that give theoretical
  ground for the use of general structured matrices in the nonlinear setting. We empirically
  verify our theoretical findings and show the dependence of learning via structured
  hashed projections on the performance of neural network as well as nearest neighbor
  classifier.
