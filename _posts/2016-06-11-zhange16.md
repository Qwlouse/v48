title: 'Provable Non-convex Phase Retrieval with Outliers: Median TruncatedWirtinger
  Flow'
abstract: Solving systems of quadratic equations is a central problem in machine learning
  and signal processing. One important example is phase retrieval, which aims to recover
  a signal from only magnitudes of its linear measurements. This paper focuses on
  the situation when the measurements are corrupted by arbitrary outliers, for which
  the recently developed non-convex gradient descent Wirtinger flow (WF) and truncated
  Wirtinger flow (TWF) algorithms likely fail. We develop a novel median-TWF algorithm
  that exploits robustness of sample median to resist arbitrary outliers in the initialization
  and the gradient update in each iteration. We show that such a non-convex algorithm
  provably recovers the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements composed
  of i.i.d. Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant portion
  of the measurements are corrupted by arbitrary outliers. We further show that median-TWF
  is also robust when measurements are corrupted by both arbitrary outliers and bounded
  noise. Our analysis of performance guarantee is accomplished by development of non-trivial
  concentration measures of median-related quantities, which may be of independent
  interest. We further provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the approach.
