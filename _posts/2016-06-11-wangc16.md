title: On the Statistical Limits of Convex Relaxations
abstract: 'Many high dimensional sparse learning problems are formulated as nonconvex
  optimization. A popular approach to solve these nonconvex optimization problems
  is through convex relaxations such as linear and semidefinite programming. In this
  paper, we study the statistical limits of convex relaxations. Particularly, we consider
  two problems: Mean estimation for sparse principal submatrix and edge probability
  estimation for stochastic block model. We exploit the sum-of-squares relaxation
  hierarchy to sharply characterize the limits of a broad class of convex relaxations.
  Our result shows statistical optimality needs to be compromised for achieving computational
  tractability using convex relaxations. Compared with existing results on computational
  lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms
  and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection,
  our theory focuses on a broad class of convex relaxations and does not rely on unproven
  hypotheses.'
