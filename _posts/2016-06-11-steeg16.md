title: The Information Sieve
abstract: We introduce a new framework for unsupervised learning of representations
  based on a novel hierarchical decomposition of information. Intuitively, data is
  passed through a series of progressively fine-grained sieves. Each layer of the
  sieve recovers a single latent factor that is maximally informative about multivariate
  dependence in the data. The data is transformed after each pass so that the remaining
  unexplained information trickles down to the next layer. Ultimately, we are left
  with a set of latent factors explaining all the dependence in the original data
  and remainder information consisting of independent noise. We present a practical
  implementation of this framework for discrete variables and apply it to a variety
  of fundamental tasks in unsupervised learning including independent component analysis,
  lossy and lossless compression, and predicting missing values in data.
