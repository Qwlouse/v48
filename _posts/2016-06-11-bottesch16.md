title: Speeding up k-means by approximating Euclidean distances via block vectors
abstract: This paper introduces a new method to approximate Euclidean distances between
  points using block vectors in combination with the Hölder inequality. By defining
  lower bounds based on the proposed approximation, cluster algorithms can be considerably
  accelerated without loss of quality. In extensive experiments, we show a considerable
  reduction in terms of computational time in comparison to standard methods and the
  recently proposed Yinyang k-means. Additionally we show that the memory consumption
  of the presented clustering algorithm does not depend on the number of clusters,
  which makes the approach suitable for large scale problems.
