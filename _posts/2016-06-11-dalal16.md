title: Hierarchical Decision Making In Electricity Grid Management
abstract: The power grid is a complex and vital system that necessitates careful reliability
  management. Managing the grid is a difficult problem with multiple time scales of
  decision making and stochastic behavior due to renewable energy generations, variable
  demand and unplanned outages. Solving this problem in the face of uncertainty requires
  a new methodology with tractable algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new model
  for hierarchical decision making in complex systems. We apply reinforcement learning
  (RL) methods to learn a proxy, i.e., a level of abstraction, for real-time power
  grid reliability. We devise an algorithm that alternates between slow time-scale
  policy improvement, and fast time-scale value function approximation. We compare
  our results to prevailing heuristics, and show the strength of our method.
