title: Additive Approximations in High Dimensional Nonparametric Regression via the
  SALSA
abstract: High dimensional nonparametric regression is an inherently difficult problem
  with known lower bounds depending exponentially in dimension. A popular strategy
  to alleviate this curse of dimensionality has been to use additive models of \emphfirst
  order, which model the regression function as a sum of independent functions on
  each dimension. Though useful in controlling the variance of the estimate, such
  models are often too restrictive in practical settings. Between non-additive models
  which often have large variance and first order additive models which have large
  bias, there has been little work to exploit the trade-off in the middle via additive
  models of intermediate order. In this work, we propose salsa, which bridges this
  gap by allowing interactions between variables, but controls model capacity by limiting
  the order of interactions. salsas minimises the residual sum of squares with squared
  RKHS norm penalties. Algorithmically, it can be viewed as Kernel Ridge Regression
  with an additive kernel. When the regression function is additive, the excess risk
  is only polynomial in dimension. Using the Girard-Newton formulae, we efficiently
  sum over a combinatorial number of terms in the additive expansion. Via a comparison
  on 15 real datasets, we show that our method is competitive against 21 other alternatives.
