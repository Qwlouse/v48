title: Fast DPP Sampling for Nystrom with Application to Kernel Methods
abstract: The Nystrom method has long been popular for scaling up kernel methods.
  Its theoretical guarantees and empirical performance rely critically on the quality
  of the landmarks selected. We study landmark selection for Nystrom using Determinantal
  Point Processes (DPPs), discrete probability models that allow tractable generation
  of diverse samples. We prove that landmarks selected via DPPs guarantee bounds on
  approximation errors; subsequently, we analyze implications for kernel ridge regression.
  Contrary to prior reservations due to cubic complexity of DPP sampling, we show
  that (under certain conditions) Markov chain DPP sampling requires only linear time
  in the size of the data. We present several empirical results that support our theoretical
  analysis, and demonstrate the superior performance of DPP-based landmark selection
  compared with existing approaches.
