title: Smooth Imitation Learning for Online Sequence Prediction
abstract: We study the problem of smooth imitation learning for online sequence prediction,
  where the goal is to train a policy that can smoothly imitate demonstrated behavior
  in a dynamic and continuous environment in response to online, sequential context
  input. Since the mapping from context to behavior is often complex, we take a learning
  reduction approach to reduce smooth imitation learning to a regression problem using
  complex function classes that are regularized to ensure smoothness. We present a
  learning meta-algorithm that achieves fast and stable convergence to a good policy.
  Our approach enjoys several attractive properties, including being fully deterministic,
  employing an adaptive learning rate that can provably yield larger policy improvements
  compared to previous approaches, and the ability to ensure stable convergence. Our
  empirical results demonstrate significant performance gains over previous approaches.
