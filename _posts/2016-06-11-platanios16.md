title: 'Estimating Accuracy from Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Approach'
abstract: We consider the question of how unlabeled data can be used to estimate the
  true accuracy of learned classifiers, and the related question of how outputs from
  several classifiers performing the same task can be combined based on their estimated
  accuracies. To answer these questions, we first present a simple graphical model
  that performs well in practice. We then provide two nonparametric extensions to
  it that improve its performance. Experiments on two real-world data sets produce
  accuracy estimates within a few percent of the true accuracy, using solely unlabeled
  data. Our models also outperform existing state-of-the-art solutions in both estimating
  accuracies, and combining multiple classifier outputs.
