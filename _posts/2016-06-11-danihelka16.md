title: Associative Long Short-Term Memory
abstract: 'We investigate a new method to augment recurrent neural networks with extra
  memory without increasing the number of network parameters. The system has an associative
  memory based on complex-valued vectors and is closely related to Holographic Reduced
  Representations and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Holographic Reduced Representations
  have limited capacity: as they store more information, each retrieval becomes noisier
  due to interference. Our system in contrast creates redundant copies of stored information,
  which enables retrieval with reduced noise. Experiments demonstrate faster learning
  on multiple memorization tasks.'
