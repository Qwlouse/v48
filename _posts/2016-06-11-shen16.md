title: Online Low-Rank Subspace Clustering by Basis Dictionary Pursuit
abstract: Low-Rank RepresentationÂ (LRR) has been a significant method for segmenting
  data that are generated from a union of subspaces. It is also known that solving
  LRR is challenging in terms of time complexity and memory footprint, in that the
  size of the nuclear norm regularized matrix is n-by-n (where n is the number of
  samples). In this paper, we thereby develop a novel online implementation of LRR
  that reduces the memory cost from O(n^2) to O(pd), with p being the ambient dimension
  and d being some estimated rank (d < p < n). We also establish the theoretical guarantee
  that the sequence of solutions produced by our algorithm converges to a stationary
  point of the expected loss function asymptotically. Extensive experiments on synthetic
  and realistic datasets further substantiate that our algorithm is fast, robust and
  memory efficient.
