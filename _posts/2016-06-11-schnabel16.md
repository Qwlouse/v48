title: 'Recommendations as Treatments: Debiasing Learning and Evaluation'
abstract: Most data for evaluating and training recommender systems is subject to
  selection biases, either through self-selection by the users or through the actions
  of the recommendation system itself. In this paper, we provide a principled approach
  to handle selection biases by adapting models and estimation techniques from causal
  inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased
  data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved
  prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize
  the robustness of the approach, and find that it is highly practical and scalable.
