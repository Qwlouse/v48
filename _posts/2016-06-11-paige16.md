title: Inference Networks for Sequential Monte Carlo in Graphical Models
abstract: We introduce a new approach for amortizing inference in directed graphical
  models by learning heuristic approximations to stochastic inverses, designed specifically
  for use as proposal distributions in sequential Monte Carlo methods. We describe
  a procedure for constructing and learning a structured neural network which represents
  an inverse factorization of the graphical model, resulting in a conditional density
  estimator that takes as input particular values of the observed random variables,
  and returns an approximation to the distribution of the latent variables. This recognition
  model can be learned offline, independent from any particular dataset, prior to
  performing inference. The output of these networks can be used as automatically-learned
  high-quality proposal distributions to accelerate sequential Monte Carlo across
  a diverse range of problem settings.
