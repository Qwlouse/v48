title: PAC learning of Probabilistic Automaton based on the Method of Moments
abstract: Probabilitic Finite Automata (PFA) are generative graphical models that
  define distributions with latent variables over finite sequences of symbols, a.k.a.
  stochastic languages. Traditionally, unsupervised learning of PFA is performed through
  algorithms that iteratively improves the likelihood like the Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm. Recently, learning algorithms based on the so-called Method of Moments
  (MoM) have been proposed as a much faster alternative that comes with PAC-style
  guarantees. However, these algorithms do not ensure the learnt automata to model
  a proper distribution, limiting their applicability and preventing them to serve
  as an initialization to iterative algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new MoM-based
  algorithm with PAC-style guarantees that learns automata defining proper distributions.
  We assess its performances on synthetic problems from the PAutomaC challenge and
  real datasets extracted from Wikipedia against previous MoM-based algorithms and
  EM algorithm.
