title: Discriminative Embeddings of Latent Variable Models for Structured Data
abstract: Kernel classifiers and regressors designed for structured data, such as
  sequences, trees and graphs, have significantly advanced a number of interdisciplinary
  areas such as computational biology and drug design. Typically, kernels are designed
  beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or
  make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier
  is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant
  two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data
  points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations.
  We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data
  representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature
  spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly,
  structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in
  a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief
  propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec
  runs 2 times faster, produces models which are 10,000 times smaller, while at the
  same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance.
