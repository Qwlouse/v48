title: Primal-Dual Rates and Certificates
abstract: We propose an algorithm-independent framework to equip existing optimization
  methods with primal-dual certificates. Such certificates and corresponding rate
  of convergence guarantees are important for practitioners to diagnose progress,
  in particular in machine learning applications. We obtain new primal-dual convergence
  rates, e.g., for the Lasso as well as many L1, Elastic Net, group Lasso and TV-regularized
  problems. The theory applies to any norm-regularized generalized linear model. Our
  approach provides efficiently computable duality gaps which are globally defined,
  without modifying the original problems in the region of interest.
