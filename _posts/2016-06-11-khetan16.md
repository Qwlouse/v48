title: Data-driven Rank Breaking for Efficient Rank Aggregation
abstract: Rank aggregation systems collect ordinal preferences from individuals to
  produce a global ranking that represents the social preference. To reduce the computational
  complexity of learning the global ranking, a common practice is to use rank-breaking.
  Individualsâ€™ preferences are broken into pairwise comparisons and then applied to
  efficient algorithms tailored for independent pairwise comparisons. However, due
  to the ignored dependencies, naive rank-breaking approaches can result in inconsistent
  estimates. The key idea to produce unbiased and accurate estimates is to treat the
  paired comparisons outcomes unequally, depending on the topology of the collected
  data. In this paper, we provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only
  achieves consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to characterize
  the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and complexity in some canonical scenarios.
  Further, we identify how the accuracy depends on the spectral gap of a corresponding
  comparison graph.
