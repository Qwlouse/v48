title: Discrete Distribution Estimation under Local Privacy
abstract: The collection and analysis of user data drives improvements in the app
  and web ecosystems, but comes with risks to privacy. This paper examines discrete
  distribution estimation under local privacy, a setting wherein service providers
  can learn the distribution of a categorical statistic of interest without collecting
  the underlying data. We present new mechanisms, including hashed k-ary Randomized
  Response (KRR), that empirically meet or exceed the utility of existing mechanisms
  at all privacy levels. New theoretical results demonstrate the order-optimality
  of KRR and the existing RAPPOR mechanism at different privacy regimes.
