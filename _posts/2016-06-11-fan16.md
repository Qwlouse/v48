title: Accurate Robust and Efficient Error Estimation for Decision Trees
abstract: This paper illustrates a novel approach to the estimation of generalization
  error of decision tree classifiers. We set out the study of decision tree errors
  in the context of consistency analysis theory, which proved that the Bayes error
  can be achieved only if when the number of data samples thrown into each leaf node
  goes to infinity. For the more challenging and practical case where the sample size
  is finite or small, a novel sampling error term is introduced in this paper to cope
  with the small sample problem effectively and efficiently. Extensive experimental
  results show that the proposed error estimate is superior to the well known K-fold
  cross validation methods in terms of robustness and accuracy. Moreover it is orders
  of magnitudes more efficient than cross validation methods.
