title: 'Beyond Parity Constraints: Fourier Analysis of Hash Functions for Inference'
abstract: Random projections have played an important role in scaling up machine learning
  and data mining algorithms. Recently they have also been applied to probabilistic
  inference to estimate properties of high-dimensional distributions; however, they
  all rely on the same class of projections based on universal hashing. We provide
  a general framework to analyze random projections which relates their statistical
  properties to their Fourier spectrum, which is a well-studied area of theoretical
  computer science. Using this framework we introduce two new classes of hash functions
  for probabilistic inference and model counting that show promising performance on
  synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
