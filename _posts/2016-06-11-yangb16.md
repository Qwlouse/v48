title: 'Tracking Slowly Moving Clairvoyant: Optimal Dynamic Regret of Online Learning
  with True and Noisy Gradient'
abstract: This work focuses on dynamic regret of online convex optimization that compares
  the performance of online learning to a clairvoyant who knows the sequence of loss
  functions in advance and hence selects the minimizer of the loss function at each
  step. By assuming that the clairvoyant moves slowly (i.e., the minimizers change
  slowly), we present several improved variation-based upper bounds of the dynamic
  regret under the true and noisy gradient feedback, which are \it optimal in light
  of the presented lower bounds. The key to our analysis is to explore a regularity
  metric that measures the temporal changes in the clairvoyantâ€™s minimizers, to which
  we refer as path variation. Firstly, we present a general lower bound in terms of
  the path variation, and then show that under full information or gradient feedback
  we are able to achieve an optimal dynamic regret. Secondly, we present a lower bound
  with noisy gradient feedback and then show that we can achieve optimal dynamic regrets
  under a stochastic gradient feedback and two-point bandit feedback. Moreover, for
  a sequence of smooth loss functions that admit a small variation in the gradients,
  our dynamic regret under the two-point bandit feedback matches that is achieved
  with full information.
