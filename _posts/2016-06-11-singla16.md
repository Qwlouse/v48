title: Actively Learning Hemimetrics with Applications to Eliciting User Preferences
abstract: Motivated by an application of eliciting users’ preferences, we investigate
  the problem of learning hemimetrics, i.e., pairwise distances among a set of n items
  that satisfy triangle inequalities and non-negativity constraints. In our application,
  the (asymmetric) distances quantify private costs a user incurs when substituting
  one item by another. We aim to learn these distances (costs) by asking the users
  whether they are willing to switch from one item to another for a given incentive
  offer. Without exploiting structural constraints of the hemimetric polytope, learning
  the distances between each pair of items requires Θ(n^2) queries. We propose an
  active learning algorithm that substantially reduces this sample complexity by exploiting
  the structural constraints on the version space of hemimetrics. Our proposed algorithm
  achieves provably-optimal sample complexity for various instances of the task. For
  example, when the items are embedded into K tight clusters, the sample complexity
  of our algorithm reduces to O(n K). Extensive experiments on a restaurant recommendation
  data set support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis.
