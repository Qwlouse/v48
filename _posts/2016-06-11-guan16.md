title: Efficient Multi-Instance Learning for Activity Recognition from Time Series
  Data Using an Auto-Regressive Hidden Markov Model
abstract: Activity recognition from sensor data has spurred a great deal of interest
  due to its impact on health care. Prior work on activity recognition from multivariate
  time series data has mainly applied supervised learning techniques which require
  a high degree of annotation effort to produce training data with the start and end
  times of each activity. In order to reduce the annotation effort, we present a weakly
  supervised approach based on multi-instance learning. We introduce a generative
  graphical model for multi-instance learning on time series data based on an auto-regressive
  hidden Markov model. Our model has a number of advantages, including the ability
  to produce both bag and instance-level predictions as well as an efficient exact
  inference algorithm based on dynamic programming.
