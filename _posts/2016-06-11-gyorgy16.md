title: Shifting Regret, Mirror Descent, and Matrices
abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction in changing environments. In
  this framework the performance of a predictor is evaluated as the loss relative
  to an arbitrarily changing predictor, whose individual components come from a base
  class of predictors. Typical results in the literature consider different base classes
  (experts, linear predictors on the simplex, etc.) separately. Introducing an arbitrary
  mapping inside the mirror decent algorithm, we provide a framework that unifies
  and extends existing results. As an example, we prove new shifting regret bounds
  for matrix prediction problems.
