title: No-Regret Algorithms for Heavy-Tailed Linear Bandits
abstract: 'We analyze the problem of linear bandits under heavy tailed noise. Most
  of of the work on linear bandits has been based on the assumption of bounded or
  sub-Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is often violated in common scenarios
  such as financial markets. We present two algorithms to tackle this problem: one
  based on dynamic truncation and one based on a median of means estimator. We show
  that, when the noise admits admits only a 1 + εmoment, these algorithms are still
  able to achieve regret in \widetildeO(T^\frac2 + ε2(1 + ε)) and \widetildeO(T^\frac1+
  2ε1 + 3 ε) respectively. In particular, they guarantee sublinear regret as long
  as the noise has finite variance. We also present empirical results showing that
  our algorithms achieve a better performance than the current state of the art for
  bounded noise when the L_∞bound on the noise is large yet the 1 + εmoment of the
  noise is small.'
