title: Autoencoding beyond pixels using a learned similarity metric
abstract: We present an autoencoder that leverages learned representations to better
  measure similarities in data space. By combining a variational autoencoder (VAE)
  with a generative adversarial network (GAN) we can use learned feature representations
  in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction objective. Thereby,
  we replace element-wise errors with feature-wise errors to better capture the data
  distribution while offering invariance towards e.g. translation. We apply our method
  to images of faces and show that it outperforms VAEs with element-wise similarity
  measures in terms of visual fidelity. Moreover, we show that the method learns an
  embedding in which high-level abstract visual features (e.g. wearing glasses) can
  be modified using simple arithmetic.
