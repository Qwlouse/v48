title: PAC Lower Bounds and Efficient Algorithms for The Max $K$-Armed Bandit Problem
abstract: We consider the Max K-Armed Bandit problem, where a learning agent is faced
  with several stochastic arms, each a source of i.i.d. rewards of unknown distribution.
  At each time step the agent chooses an arm, and observes the reward of the obtained
  sample. Each sample is considered here as a separate item with the reward designating
  its value, and the goal is to find an item with the highest possible value. Our
  basic assumption is a known lower bound on the \em tail function of the reward distributions.
  Under the PAC framework, we provide a lower bound on the sample complexity of any
  (ε,δ)-correct algorithm, and propose an algorithm that attains this bound up to
  logarithmic factors. We provide an analysis of the robustness of the proposed algorithm
  to the model assumptions, and further compare its performance to the simple non-adaptive
  variant, in which the arms are chosen randomly at each stage.
