title: Clustering High Dimensional Categorical Data via Topographical Features
abstract: Analysis of categorical data is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose
  to compute topographical features of high-dimensional categorical data. We propose
  an efficient algorithm to extract modes of the underlying distribution and their
  attractive basins. These topographical features provide a geometric view of the
  data and can be applied to visualization and clustering of real world challenging
  datasets. Experiments show that our principled method outperforms state-of-the-art
  clustering methods while also admits an embarrassingly parallel property.
