title: Generalization and Exploration via Randomized Value Functions
abstract: 'We propose randomized least-squares value iteration (RLSVI) â€“ a new reinforcement
  learning algorithm designed to explore and generalize efficiently via linearly parameterized
  value functions. We explain why versions of least-squares value iteration that use
  Boltzmann or epsilon-greedy exploration can be highly inefficient, and we present
  computational results that demonstrate dramatic efficiency gains enjoyed by RLSVI.
  Further, we establish an upper bound on the expected regret of RLSVI that demonstrates
  near-optimality in a tabula rasa learning context. More broadly, our results suggest
  that randomized value functions offer a promising approach to tackling a critical
  challenge in reinforcement learning: synthesizing efficient exploration and effective
  generalization.'
