title: Gaussian process nonparametric tensor estimator and its minimax optimality
abstract: We investigate the statistical efficiency of a nonparametric Gaussian process
  method for a nonlinear tensor estimation problem. Low-rank tensor estimation has
  been used as a method to learn higher order relations among several data sources
  in a wide range of applications, such as multi-task learning, recommendation systems,
  and spatiotemporal analysis. We consider a general setting where a common linear
  tensor learning is extended to a nonlinear learning problem in reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space and propose a nonparametric Bayesian method based on the Gaussian
  process method. We prove its statistical convergence rate without assuming any strong
  convexity, such as restricted strong convexity. Remarkably, it is shown that our
  convergence rate achieves the minimax optimal rate. We apply our proposed method
  to multi-task learning and show that our method significantly outperforms existing
  methods through numerical experiments on real-world data sets.
