title: Complex Embeddings for Simple Link Prediction
abstract: In statistical relational learning, the link prediction problem is key to
  automatically understand the structure of large knowledge bases. As in previous
  studies, we propose to solve this problem through latent factorization. However,
  here we make use of complex valued embeddings. The composition of complex embeddings
  can handle a large variety of binary relations, among them symmetric and antisymmetric
  relations. Compared to state-of-the-art models such as Neural Tensor Network and
  Holographic Embeddings, our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simpler,
  as it only uses the Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard
  dot product between real vectors. Our approach is scalable to large datasets as
  it remains linear in both space and time, while consistently outperforming alternative
  approaches on standard link prediction benchmarks.
