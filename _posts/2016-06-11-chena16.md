title: Community Recovery in Graphs with Locality
abstract: Motivated by applications in domains such as social networks and computational
  biology, we study the problem of community recovery in graphs with locality. In
  this problem, pairwise noisy measurements of whether two nodes are in the same community
  or different communities come mainly or exclusively from nearby nodes rather than
  uniformly sampled between all node pairs, as in most existing models. We present
  two algorithms that run nearly linearly in the number of measurements and which
  achieve the information limits for exact recovery.
