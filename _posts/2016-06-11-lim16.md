title: A Box-Constrained Approach for Hard Permutation Problems
abstract: We describe the use of sorting networks to form relaxations of problems
  involving permutations of n objects. This approach is an alternative to relaxations
  based on the Birkhoff polytope (the set of n \times n doubly stochastic matrices),
  providing a more compact formulation in which the only constraints are box constraints.
  Using this approach, we form a variant of the relaxation of the quadratic assignment
  problem recently studied in Vogelstein et al. (2015), and show that the continuation
  method applied to this formulation can be quite effective. We develop a coordinate
  descent algorithm that achieves a per-cycle complexity of O(n^2 \log^2 n). We compare
  this method with Fast Approximate QAP (FAQ) algorithm introduced in Vogelstein et
  al. (2015), which uses a conditional-gradient method whose per-iteration complexity
  is O(n^3). We demonstrate that for most problems in QAPLIB and for a class of synthetic
  QAP problems, the sorting-network formulation returns solutions that are competitive
  with the FAQ algorithm, often in significantly less computing time.
