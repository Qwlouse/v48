title: Hierarchical Span-Based Conditional Random Fields for Labeling and Segmenting
  Events in Wearable Sensor Data Streams
abstract: The field of mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to yield new insights
  into health and behavior through the analysis of continuously recorded data from
  wearable health and activity sensors. In this paper, we present a hierarchical span-based
  conditional random field model for the key problem of jointly detecting discrete
  events in such sensor data streams and segmenting these events into high-level activity
  sessions. Our model includes higher-order cardinality factors and inter-event duration
  factors to capture domain-specific structure in the label space. We show that our
  model supports exact MAP inference in quadratic time via dynamic programming, which
  we leverage to perform learning in the structured support vector machine framework.
  We apply the model to the problems of smoking and eating detection using four real
  data sets. Our results show statistically significant improvements in segmentation
  performance relative to a hierarchical pairwise CRF.
