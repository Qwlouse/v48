title: Stability of Controllers for Gaussian Process Forward Models
abstract: Learning control has become an appealing alternative to the derivation of
  control laws based on classic control theory. However, a major shortcoming of learning
  control is the lack of performance guarantees which prevents its application in
  many real-world scenarios. As a step in this direction, we provide a stability analysis
  tool for controllers acting on dynamics represented by Gaussian processes (GPs).
  We consider arbitrary Markovian control policies and system dynamics given as (i)
  the mean of a GP, and (ii) the full GP distribution. For the first case, our tool
  finds a state space region, where the closed-loop system is provably stable. In
  the second case, it is well known that infinite horizon stability guarantees cannot
  exist. Instead, our tool analyzes finite time stability. Empirical evaluations on
  simulated benchmark problems support our theoretical results.
