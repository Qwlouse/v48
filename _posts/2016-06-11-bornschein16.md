title: Bidirectional Helmholtz Machines
abstract: Efficient unsupervised training and inference in deep generative models
  remains a challenging problem. One basic approach, called Helmholtz machine or Variational
  Autoencoder, involves training a top-down directed generative model together with
  a bottom-up auxiliary model used for approximate inference. Recent results indicate
  that better generative models can be obtained with better approximate inference
  procedures. Instead of improving the inference procedure, we here propose a new
  model, the bidirectional Helmholtz machine, which guarantees that the top-down and
  bottom-up distributions can efficiently invert each other. We achieve this by interpreting
  both the top-down and the bottom-up directed models as approximate inference distributions
  and by defining the model distribution to be the geometric mean of these two. We
  present a lower-bound for the likelihood of this model and we show that optimizing
  this bound regularizes the model so that the Bhattacharyya distance between the
  bottom-up and top-down approximate distributions is minimized. This approach results
  in state of the art generative models which prefer significantly deeper architectures
  while it allows for orders of magnitude more efficient likelihood estimation.
