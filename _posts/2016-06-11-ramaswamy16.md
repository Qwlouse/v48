title: Mixture Proportion Estimation via Kernel Embeddings of Distributions
abstract: Mixture proportion estimation (MPE) is the problem of estimating the weight
  of a component distribution in a mixture, given samples from the mixture and component.
  This problem constitutes a key part in many "weakly supervised learning" problems
  like learning with positive and unlabelled samples, learning with label noise, anomaly
  detection and crowdsourcing. While there have been several methods proposed to solve
  this problem, to the best of our knowledge no efficient algorithm with a proven
  convergence rate towards the true proportion exists for this problem. We fill this
  gap by constructing a provably correct algorithm for MPE, and derive convergence
  rates under certain assumptions on the distribution. Our method is based on embedding
  distributions onto an RKHS, and implementing it only requires solving a simple convex
  quadratic programming problem a few times. We run our algorithm on several standard
  classification datasets, and demonstrate that it performs comparably to or better
  than other algorithms on most datasets.
