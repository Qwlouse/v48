title: A Simple and Strongly-Local Flow-Based Method for Cut Improvement
abstract: Many graph-based learning problems can be cast as finding a good set of
  vertices nearby a seed set, and a powerful methodology for these problems is based
  on minimum cuts and maximum flows. We introduce and analyze a new method for locally-biased
  graph-based learning called SimpleLocal, which finds good conductance cuts near
  a set of seed vertices. An important feature of our algorithm is that it is strongly-local,
  meaning it does not need to explore the entire graph to find cuts that are locally
  optimal. This method is related to other strongly-local flow-based methods, but
  it enables a simple implementation. We also show how it achieves localization through
  an implicit l1-norm penalty term. As a flow-based method, our algorithm exhibits
  several advantages in terms of cut optimality and accurate identification of target
  regions in a graph. We demonstrate the power of SimpleLocal solving segmentation
  problems on a 467 million edge graph based on an MRI scan.
