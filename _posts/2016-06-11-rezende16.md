title: One-Shot Generalization in Deep Generative Models
abstract: 'Humans have an impressive ability to reason about new concepts and experiences
  from just a single example. In particular, humans have an ability for one-shot generalization:
  an ability to encounter a new concept, understand its structure, and then be able
  to generate compelling alternative variations of the concept. We develop machine
  learning systems with this important capacity by developing new deep generative
  models, models that combine the representational power of deep learning with the
  inferential power of Bayesian reasoning. We develop a class of sequential generative
  models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics
  lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation
  and image generation. We demonstrate the one-shot generalization ability of our
  models using three tasks: unconditional sampling, generating new exemplars of a
  given concept, and generating new exemplars of a family of concepts. In all cases
  our models are able to generate compelling and diverse samples—having seen new examples
  just once—providing an important class of general-purpose models for one-shot machine
  learning.'
