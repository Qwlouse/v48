title: Dictionary Learning for Massive Matrix Factorization
abstract: Sparse matrix factorization is a popular tool to obtain interpretable data
  decompositions, which are also effective to perform data completion or denoising.
  Its applicability to large datasets has been addressed with online and randomized
  methods, that reduce the complexity in one of the matrix dimension, but not in both
  of them. In this paper, we tackle very large matrices in both dimensions. We propose
  a new factorization method that scales gracefully to terabyte-scale datasets. Those
  could not be processed by previous algorithms in a reasonable amount of time. We
  demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on massive functional Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging (fMRI) data, and on matrix completion problems for recommender systems,
  where we obtain significant speed-ups compared to state-of-the art coordinate descent
  methods.
