title: Differential Geometric Regularization for Supervised Learning of Classifiers
abstract: 'We study the problem of supervised learning for both binary and multiclass
  classification from a unified geometric perspective. In particular, we propose a
  geometric regularization technique to find the submanifold corresponding to an estimator
  of the class probability P(y|\vec x). The regularization term measures the volume
  of this submanifold, based on the intuition that overfitting produces rapid local
  oscillations and hence large volume of the estimator. This technique can be applied
  to regularize any classification function that satisfies two requirements: firstly,
  an estimator of the class probability can be obtained; secondly, first and second
  derivatives of the class probability estimator can be calculated. In experiments,
  we apply our regularization technique to standard loss functions for classification,
  our RBF-based implementation compares favorably to widely used regularization methods
  for both binary and multiclass classification.'
