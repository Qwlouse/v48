title: Efficient Private Empirical Risk Minimization for High-dimensional Learning
abstract: 'Dimensionality reduction is a popular approach for dealing with high dimensional
  data that leads to substantial computational savings. Random projections are a simple
  and effective method for universal dimensionality reduction with rigorous theoretical
  guarantees. In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of differentially
  private empirical risk minimization in the projected subspace (compressed domain).
  We ask: is it possible to design differentially private algorithms with small excess
  risk given access to only projected data? In this paper, we answer this question
  in affirmative, by showing that for the class of generalized linear functions, given
  only the projected data and the projection matrix, we can obtain excess risk bounds
  of $O(w(Theta)^2/3/n^1/3) under eps-differential privacy, and O((w(Theta)/n)^1/2)$
  under (eps,delta)-differential privacy, where n is the sample size and w(Theta)
  is the Gaussian width of the parameter space that we optimize over. A simple consequence
  of these results is that, for a large class of ERM problems, in the traditional
  setting (i.e., with access to the original data), under eps-differential privacy,
  we improve the worst-case risk bounds of Bassily et al. (FOCS 2014).'
