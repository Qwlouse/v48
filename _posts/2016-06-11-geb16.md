title: Efficient Algorithms for Large-scale Generalized Eigenvector Computation and
  Canonical Correlation Analysis
abstract: This paper considers the problem of canonical-correlation analysis (CCA)
  and, more broadly, the generalized eigenvector problem for a pair of symmetric matrices.
  These are two fundamental problems in data analysis and scientific computing with
  numerous applications in machine learning and statistics. We provide simple iterative
  algorithms, with improved runtimes, for solving these problems that are globally
  linearly convergent with moderate dependencies on the condition numbers and eigenvalue
  gaps of the matrices involved. We obtain our results by reducing CCA to the top-k
  generalized eigenvector problem. We solve this problem through a general framework
  that simply requires black box access to an approximate linear system solver. Instantiating
  this framework with accelerated gradient descent we obtain a running time of \order\fracz
  k \sqrtκρ \log(1/ε) \log \left(kκ/ρ\right) where z is the total number of nonzero
  entries, κis the condition number and ρis the relative eigenvalue gap of the appropriate
  matrices. Our algorithm is linear in the input size and the number of components
  k up to a \log(k) factor. This is essential for handling large-scale matrices that
  appear in practice. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such algorithm
  with global linear convergence. We hope that our results prompt further research
  and ultimately improve the practical running time for performing these important
  data analysis procedures on large data sets.
