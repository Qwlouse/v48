title: 'ForecastICU: A Prognostic Decision Support System for Timely Prediction of
  Intensive Care Unit Admission'
abstract: 'We develop ForecastICU: a prognostic decision support system that monitors
  hospitalized patients and prompts alarms for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.
  ForecastICU is first trained in an offline stage by constructing a Bayesian belief
  system that corresponds to its belief about how trajectories of physiological data
  streams of the patient map to a clinical status. After that, ForecastICU monitors
  a new patient in real-time by observing her physiological data stream, updating
  its belief about her status over time, and prompting an alarm whenever its belief
  process hits a predefined threshold (confidence). Using a real-world dataset obtained
  from UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, we show that ForecastICU can predict ICU
  admissions 9 hours before a physicianâ€™s decision (for a sensitivity of 40% and a
  precision of 50%). Also, ForecastICU performs consistently better than other state-of-the-art
  machine learning algorithms in terms of sensitivity, precision, and timeliness:
  it can predict ICU admissions 3 hours earlier, and offers a 7.8% gain in sensitivity
  and a 5.1% gain in precision compared to the best state-of-the-art algorithm. Moreover,
  ForecastICU offers an area under curve (AUC) gain of 22.3% compared to the Rothman
  index, which is the currently deployed technology in most hospital wards.'
