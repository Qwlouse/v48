title: 'Beyond CCA: Moment Matching for Multi-View Models'
abstract: We introduce three novel semi-parametric extensions of probabilistic canonical
  correlation analysis with identifiability guarantees. We consider moment matching
  techniques for estimation in these models. For that, by drawing explicit links between
  the new models and a discrete version of independent component analysis (DICA),
  we first extend the DICA cumulant tensors to the new discrete version of CCA. By
  further using a close connection with independent component analysis, we introduce
  generalized covariance matrices, which can replace the cumulant tensors in the moment
  matching framework, and, therefore, improve sample complexity and simplify derivations
  and algorithms significantly. As the tensor power method or orthogonal joint diagonalization
  are not applicable in the new setting, we use non-orthogonal joint diagonalization
  techniques for matching the cumulants. We demonstrate performance of the proposed
  models and estimation techniques on experiments with both synthetic and real datasets.
