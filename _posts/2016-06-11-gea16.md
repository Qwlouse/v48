title: Rich Component Analysis
abstract: In many settings, we have multiple data sets (also called views) that capture
  different and overlapping aspects of the same phenomenon. We are often interested
  in finding patterns that are unique to one or to a subset of the views. For example,
  we might have one set of molecular observations and one set of physiological observations
  on the same group of individuals, and we want to quantify molecular patterns that
  are uncorrelated with physiology. Despite being a common problem, this is highly
  challenging when the correlations come from complex distributions. In this paper,
  we develop the general framework of Rich Component Analysis (RCA) to model settings
  where the observations from different views are driven by different sets of latent
  components, and each component can be a complex, high-dimensional distribution.
  We introduce algorithms based on cumulant extraction that provably learn each of
  the components without having to model the other components. We show how to integrate
  RCA with stochastic gradient descent into a meta-algorithm for learning general
  models, and demonstrate substantial improvement in accuracy on several synthetic
  and real datasets in both supervised and unsupervised tasks. Our method makes it
  possible to learn latent variable models when we donâ€™t have samples from the true
  model but only samples after complex perturbations.
