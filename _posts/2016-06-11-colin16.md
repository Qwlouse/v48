title: Gossip Dual Averaging for Decentralized Optimization of Pairwise Functions
abstract: In decentralized networks (of sensors, connected objects, etc.), there is
  an important need for efficient algorithms to optimize a global cost function, for
  instance to learn a global model from the local data collected by each computing
  unit. In this paper, we address the problem of decentralized minimization of pairwise
  functions of the data points, where these points are distributed over the nodes
  of a graph defining the communication topology of the network. This general problem
  finds applications in ranking, distance metric learning and graph inference, among
  others. We propose new gossip algorithms based on dual averaging which aims at solving
  such problems both in synchronous and asynchronous settings. The proposed framework
  is flexible enough to deal with constrained and regularized variants of the optimization
  problem. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithms preserve
  the convergence rate of centralized dual averaging up to an additive bias term.
  We present numerical simulations on Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) maximization
  and metric learning problems which illustrate the practical interest of our approach.
