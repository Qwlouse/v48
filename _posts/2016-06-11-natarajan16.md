title: Optimal Classification with Multivariate Losses
abstract: Multivariate loss functions are extensively employed in several prediction
  tasks arising in Information Retrieval. Often, the goal in the tasks is to minimize
  expected loss when retrieving relevant items from a presented set of items, where
  the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution over item sets. Our key
  result is that for most multivariate losses, the expected loss is provably optimized
  by sorting the items by the conditional probability of label being positive and
  then selecting top k items. Such a result was previously known only for the F-measure.
  Leveraging on the optimality characterization, we give an algorithm for estimating
  optimal predictions in practice with runtime quadratic in size of item sets for
  many losses. We provide empirical results on benchmark datasets, comparing the proposed
  algorithm to state-of-the-art methods for optimizing multivariate losses.
