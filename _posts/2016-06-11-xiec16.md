title: A Theory of Generative ConvNet
abstract: 'We show that a generative random field model, which we call generative
  ConvNet, can be derived from the commonly used discriminative ConvNet, by assuming
  a ConvNet for multi-category classification and assuming one of the category is
  a base category generated by a reference distribution. If we further assume that
  the non-linearity in the ConvNet is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the reference
  distribution is Gaussian white noise, then we obtain a generative ConvNet model
  that is unique among energy-based models: The model is piecewise Gaussian, and the
  means of the Gaussian pieces are defined by an auto-encoder, where the filters in
  the bottom-up encoding become the basis functions in the top-down decoding, and
  the binary activation variables detected by the filters in the bottom-up convolution
  process become the coefficients of the basis functions in the top-down deconvolution
  process. The Langevin dynamics for sampling the generative ConvNet is driven by
  the reconstruction error of this auto-encoder. The contrastive divergence learning
  of the generative ConvNet reconstructs the training images by the auto-encoder.
  The maximum likelihood learning algorithm can synthesize realistic natural image
  patterns.'
