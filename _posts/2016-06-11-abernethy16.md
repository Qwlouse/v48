title: 'Faster Convex Optimization: Simulated Annealing with an Efficient Universal
  Barrier'
abstract: This paper explores a surprising equivalence between two seemingly-distinct
  convex optimization methods. We show that simulated annealing, a well-studied random
  walk algorithms, is *directly equivalent*, in a certain sense, to the central path
  interior point algorithm for the the entropic universal barrier function. This connection
  exhibits several benefits. First, we are able improve the state of the art time
  complexity for convex optimization under the membership oracle model by devising
  a new temperature schedule for simulated annealing motivated by central path following
  interior point methods. Second, we get an efficient randomized interior point method
  with an efficiently computable universal barrier for any convex set described by
  a membership oracle. Previously, efficiently computable barriers were known only
  for particular convex sets.
