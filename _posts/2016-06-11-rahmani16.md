title: A Subspace Learning Approach for High Dimensional Matrix Decomposition with
  Efficient Column/Row Sampling
abstract: This paper presents a new randomized approach to high-dimensional low rank
  (LR) plus sparse matrix decomposition. For a data matrix D ∈R^N_1 \times N_2, the
  complexity of conventional decomposition methods is O(N_1 N_2 r), which limits their
  usefulness in big data settings (r is the rank of the LR component). In addition,
  the existing randomized approaches rely for the most part on uniform random sampling,
  which may be inefficient for many real world data matrices. The proposed subspace
  learning based approach recovers the LR component using only a small subset of the
  columns/rows of data and reduces complexity to O(\max(N_1,N_2) r^2). Even when the
  columns/rows are sampled uniformly at random, the sufficient number of sampled columns/rows
  is shown to be roughly O(r μ), where μis the coherency parameter of the LR component.
  In addition, efficient sampling algorithms are proposed to address the problem of
  column/row sampling from structured data.
