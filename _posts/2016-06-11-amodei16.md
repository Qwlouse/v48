title: 'Deep Speech 2 : End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin'
abstract: We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognize
  either English or Mandarin Chinese speechâ€“two vastly different languages. Because
  it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks,
  end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy
  environments, accents and different languages. Key to our approach is our application
  of HPC techniques, enabling experiments that previously took weeks to now run in
  days. This allows us to iterate more quickly to identify superior architectures
  and algorithms. As a result, in several cases, our system is competitive with the
  transcription of human workers when benchmarked on standard datasets. Finally, using
  a technique called Batch Dispatch with GPUs in the data center, we show that our
  system can be inexpensively deployed in an online setting, delivering low latency
  when serving users at scale.
