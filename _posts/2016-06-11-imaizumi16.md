title: Doubly Decomposing Nonparametric Tensor Regression
abstract: Nonparametric extension of tensor regression is proposed. Nonlinearity in
  a high-dimensional tensor space is broken into simple local functions by incorporating
  low-rank tensor decomposition. Compared to naive nonparametric approaches, our formulation
  considerably improves the convergence rate of estimation while maintaining consistency
  with the same function class under specific conditions. To estimate local functions,
  we develop a Bayesian estimator with the Gaussian process prior. Experimental results
  show its theoretical properties and high performance in terms of predicting a summary
  statistic of a real complex network.
