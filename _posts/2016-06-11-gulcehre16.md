title: Noisy Activation Functions
abstract: Common nonlinear activation functions used in neural networks can cause
  training difficulties due to the saturation behavior of the activation function,
  which may hide dependencies that are not visible to vanilla-SGD (using first order
  gradients only). Gating mechanisms that use softly saturating activation functions
  to emulate the discrete switching of digital logic circuits are good examples of
  this. We propose to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that the gradients
  may flow easily, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would
  yield zero gradients. Large noise will dominate the noise-free gradient and allow
  stochastic gradient descent to explore more. By adding noise only to the problematic
  parts of the activation function, we allow the optimization procedure to explore
  the boundary between the degenerate saturating) and the well-behaved parts of the
  activation function. We also establish connections to simulated annealing, when
  the amount of noise is annealed down, making it easier to optimize hard objective
  functions. We find experimentally that replacing such saturating activation functions
  by noisy variants helps optimization in many contexts, yielding state-of-the-art
  or competitive results on different datasets and task, especially when training
  seems to be the most difficult, e.g., when curriculum learning is necessary to obtain
  good results.
