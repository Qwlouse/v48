title: Domain Adaptation with Conditional Transferable Components
abstract: Domain adaptation arises in supervised learning when the training (source
  domain) and test (target domain) data have different distributions. Let X and Y
  denote the features and target, respectively, previous work on domain adaptation
  considers the covariate shift situation where the distribution of the features P(X)
  changes across domains while the conditional distribution P(Y|X) stays the same.
  To reduce domain discrepancy, recent methods try to find invariant components \mathcalT(X)
  that have similar P(\mathcalT(X)) by explicitly minimizing a distribution discrepancy
  measure. However, it is not clear if P(Y|\mathcalT(X)) in different domains is also
  similar when P(Y|X) changes. Furthermore, transferable components do not necessarily
  have to be invariant. If the change in some components is identifiable, we can make
  use of such components for prediction in the target domain. In this paper, we focus
  on the case where P(X|Y) and P(Y) both change in a causal system in which Y is the
  cause for X. Under appropriate assumptions, we aim to extract conditional transferable
  components whose conditional distribution P(\mathcalT(X)|Y) is invariant after proper
  location-scale (LS) transformations, and identify how P(Y) changes between domains
  simultaneously. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on both
  synthetic and real-world data to show the effectiveness of our method.
