title: Markov Latent Feature Models
abstract: We introduce Markov latent feature models (MLFM), a sparse latent feature
  model that arises naturally from a simple sequential construction. The key idea
  is to interpret each state of a sequential process as corresponding to a latent
  feature, and the set of states visited between two null-state visits as picking
  out features for an observation. We show that, given some natural constraints, we
  can represent this stochastic process as a mixture of recurrent Markov chains. In
  this way we can perform correlated latent feature modeling for the sparse coding
  problem. We demonstrate two cases in which we define finite and infinite latent
  feature models constructed from first-order Markov chains, and derive their associated
  scalable inference algorithms. We show empirical results on a genome analysis task
  and an image denoising task.
