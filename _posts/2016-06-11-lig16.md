title: Gaussian quadrature for matrix inverse forms with applications
abstract: We present a framework for accelerating a spectrum of machine learning algorithms
  that require computation of \emphbilinear inverse forms u^T A^-1u, where A is a
  positive definite matrix and u a given vector. Our framework is built on Gauss-type
  quadrature and easily scales to large, sparse matrices. Further, it allows retrospective
  computation of lower and upper bounds on u^T A^-1u, which in turn accelerates several
  algorithms. We prove that these bounds tighten iteratively and converge at a linear
  (geometric) rate. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to demonstrate these
  key properties of Gauss-type quadrature, which is a classical and deeply studied
  topic. We illustrate empirical consequences of our results by using quadrature to
  accelerate machine learning tasks involving determinantal point processes and submodular
  optimization, and observe tremendous speedups in several instances.
