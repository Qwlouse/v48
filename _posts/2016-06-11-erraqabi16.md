title: Pliable Rejection Sampling
abstract: Rejection sampling is a technique for sampling from difficult distributions.
  However, its use is limited due to a high rejection rate. Common adaptive rejection
  sampling methods either work only for very specific distributions or without performance
  guarantees. In this paper, we present pliable rejection sampling (PRS), a new approach
  to rejection sampling, where we learn the sampling proposal using a kernel estimator.
  Since our method builds on rejection sampling, the samples obtained are with high
  probability i.i.d. and distributed according to f. Moreover, PRS comes with a guarantee
  on the number of accepted samples.
