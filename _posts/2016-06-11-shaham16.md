title: A Deep Learning Approach to Unsupervised Ensemble Learning
abstract: We show how deep learning methods can be applied in the context of crowdsourcing
  and unsupervised ensemble learning. First, we prove that the popular model of Dawid
  and Skene, which assumes that all classifiers are conditionally independent, is
  \em equivalent to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with a single hidden node.
  Hence, under this model, the posterior probabilities of the true labels can be instead
  estimated via a trained RBM. Next, to address the more general case, where classifiers
  may strongly violate the conditional independence assumption, we propose to apply
  RBM-based Deep Neural Net (DNN). Experimental results on various simulated and real-world
  datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNN approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods, in particular when the data violates the conditional independence assumption.
