title: Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control
abstract: Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances
  in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement learning.
  Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games based on raw pixel
  data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw sensory inputs. However,
  it has been difficult to quantify progress in the domain of continuous control due
  to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this work, we present a benchmark
  suite of continuous control tasks, including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up,
  tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion,
  tasks with partial observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure. We report
  novel findings based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement
  learning algorithms. Both the benchmark and reference implementations are released
  at https://github.com/rllab/rllab in order to facilitate experimental reproducibility
  and to encourage adoption by other researchers.
