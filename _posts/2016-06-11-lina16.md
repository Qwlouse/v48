title: Generalization Properties and Implicit Regularization for Multiple Passes SGM
abstract: We study the generalization properties of stochastic gradient methods for
  learning with convex loss functions and linearly parameterized functions. We show
  that, in the absence of penalizations or constraints, the stability and approximation
  properties of the algorithm can be controlled by tuning either the step-size or
  the number of passes over the data. In this view, these parameters can be seen to
  control a form of implicit regularization. Numerical results complement the theoretical
  findings.
