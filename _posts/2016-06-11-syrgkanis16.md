title: Efficient Algorithms for Adversarial Contextual Learning
abstract: 'We provide the first oracle efficient sublinear regret algorithms for adversarial
  versions of the contextual bandit problem. In this problem, the learner repeatedly
  makes an action on the basis of a context and receives reward for the chosen action,
  with the goal of achieving reward competitive with a large class of policies. We
  analyze two settings: i) in the transductive setting the learner knows the set of
  contexts a priori, ii) in the small separator setting, there exists a small set
  of contexts such that any two policies behave differently on one of the contexts
  in the set. Our algorithms fall into the Follow-The-Perturbed-Leader family (Kalai
  and Vempala, 2005) and achieve regret O(T^3/4\sqrtK\log(N)) in the transductive
  setting and O(T^2/3 d^3/4 K\sqrt\log(N)) in the separator setting, where T is the
  number of rounds, K is the number of actions, N is the number of baseline policies,
  and d is the size of the separator. We actually solve the more general adversarial
  contextual semi-bandit linear optimization problem, whilst in the full information
  setting we address the even more general contextual combinatorial optimization.
  We provide several extensions and implications of our algorithms, such as switching
  regret and efficient learning with predictable sequences.'
