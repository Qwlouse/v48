title: 'Graying the black box: Understanding DQNs'
abstract: In recent years there is a growing interest in using deep representations
  for reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a methodology and tools to
  analyze Deep Q-networks (DQNs) in a non-blind matter. Using our tools we reveal
  that the features learned by DQNs aggregate the state space in a hierarchical fashion,
  explaining its success. Moreover we are able to understand and describe the policies
  learned by DQNs for three different Atari2600 games and suggest ways to interpret,
  debug and optimize of deep neural networks in Reinforcement Learning.
