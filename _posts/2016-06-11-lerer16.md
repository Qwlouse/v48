title: Learning Physical Intuition of Block Towers by Example
abstract: 'Wooden blocks are a common toy for infants, allowing them to develop motor
  skills and gain intuition about the physical behavior of the world. In this paper,
  we explore the ability of deep feed-forward models to learn such intuitive physics.
  Using a 3D game engine, we create small towers of wooden blocks whose stability
  is randomized and render them collapsing (or remaining upright). This data allows
  us to train large convolutional network models which can accurately predict the
  outcome, as well as estimating the trajectories of the blocks. The models are also
  able to generalize in two important ways: (i) to new physical scenarios, e.g. towers
  with an additional block and (ii) to images of real wooden blocks, where it obtains
  a performance comparable to human subjects.'
