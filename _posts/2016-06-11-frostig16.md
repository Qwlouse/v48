title: Principal Component Projection Without Principal Component Analysis
abstract: We show how to efficiently project a vector onto the top principal components
  of a matrix, *without explicitly computing these components*. Specifically, we introduce
  an iterative algorithm that provably computes the projection using few calls to
  any black-box routine for ridge regression. By avoiding explicit principal component
  analysis (PCA), our algorithm is the first with no runtime dependence on the number
  of top principal components. We show that it can be used to give a fast iterative
  method for the popular principal component regression problem, giving the first
  major runtime improvement over the naive method of combining PCA with regression.
  To achieve our results, we first observe that ridge regression can be used to obtain
  a "smooth projection" onto the top principal components. We then sharpen this approximation
  to true projection using a low-degree polynomial approximation to the matrix step
  function. Step function approximation is a topic of long-term interest in scientific
  computing. We extend prior theory by constructing polynomials with simple iterative
  structure and rigorously analyzing their behavior under limited precision.
