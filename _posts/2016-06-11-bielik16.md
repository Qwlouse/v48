title: 'PHOG: Probabilistic Model for Code'
abstract: We introduce a new generative model for code called probabilistic higher
  order grammar (PHOG). PHOG generalizes probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs)
  by allowing conditioning of a production rule beyond the parent non-terminal, thus
  capturing rich contexts relevant to programs. Even though PHOG is more powerful
  than a PCFG, it can be learned from data just as efficiently. We trained a PHOG
  model on a large JavaScript code corpus and show that it is more precise than existing
  models, while similarly fast. As a result, PHOG can immediately benefit existing
  programming tools based on probabilistic models of code.
