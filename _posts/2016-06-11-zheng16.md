title: A Neural Autoregressive Approach to Collaborative Filtering
abstract: This paper proposes CF-NADE, a neural autoregressive architecture for collaborative
  filtering (CF) tasks, which is inspired by the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
  based CF model and the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (NADE). We first
  describe the basic CF-NADE model for CF tasks. Then we propose to improve the model
  by sharing parameters between different ratings. A factored version of CF-NADE is
  also proposed for better scalability. Furthermore, we take the ordinal nature of
  the preferences into consideration and propose an ordinal cost to optimize CF-NADE,
  which shows superior performance. Finally, CF-NADE can be extended to a deep model,
  with only moderately increased computational complexity. Experimental results show
  that CF-NADE with a single hidden layer beats all previous state-of-the-art methods
  on MovieLens 1M, MovieLens 10M, and Netflix datasets, and adding more hidden layers
  can further improve the performance.
