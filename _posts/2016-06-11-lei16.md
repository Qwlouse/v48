title: Power of Ordered Hypothesis Testing
abstract: Ordered testing procedures are multiple testing procedures that exploit
  a pre-specified ordering of the null hypotheses, from most to least promising. We
  analyze and compare the power of several recent proposals using the asymptotic framework
  of Li & Barber (2015). While accumulation tests including ForwardStop can be quite
  powerful when the ordering is very informative, they are asymptotically powerless
  when the ordering is weaker. By contrast, Selective SeqStep, proposed by Barber
  & Candes (2015), is much less sensitive to the quality of the ordering. We compare
  the power of these procedures in different regimes, concluding that Selective SeqStep
  dominates accumulation tests if either the ordering is weak or non-null hypotheses
  are sparse or weak. Motivated by our asymptotic analysis, we derive an improved
  version of Selective SeqStep which we call Adaptive SeqStep, analogous to Storeyâ€™s
  improvement on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We compare these methods using
  the GEO-Query data set analyzed by (Li & Barber, 2015) and find Adaptive SeqStep
  has favorable performance for both good and bad prior orderings.
