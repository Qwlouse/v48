title: Learning Granger Causality for Hawkes Processes
abstract: Learning Granger causality for general point processes is a very challenging
  task. We propose an effective method learning Granger causality for a special but
  significant type of point processes — Hawkes processes. Focusing on Hawkes processes,
  we reveal the relationship between Hawkes process’s impact functions and its Granger
  causality graph. Specifically, our model represents impact functions using a series
  of basis functions and recovers the Granger causality graph via group sparsity of
  the impact functions’ coefficients. We propose an effective learning algorithm combining
  a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) with a sparse-group-lasso (SGL) regularizer.
  Additionally, the pairwise similarity between the dimensions of the process is considered
  when their clustering structure is available. We analyze our learning method and
  discuss the selection of the basis functions. Experiments on synthetic data and
  real-world data show that our method can learn the Granger causality graph and the
  triggering patterns of Hawkes processes simultaneously.
