title: 'BISTRO: An Efficient Relaxation-Based Method for Contextual Bandits'
abstract: We present efficient algorithms for the problem of contextual bandits with
  i.i.d. covariates, an arbitrary sequence of rewards, and an arbitrary class of policies.
  Our algorithm BISTRO requires d calls to the empirical risk minimization (ERM) oracle
  per round, where d is the number of actions. The method uses unlabeled data to make
  the problem computationally simple. When the ERM problem itself is computationally
  hard, we extend the approach by employing multiplicative approximation algorithms
  for the ERM. The integrality gap of the relaxation only enters in the regret bound
  rather than the benchmark. Finally, we show that the adversarial version of the
  contextual bandit problem is learnable (and efficient) whenever the full-information
  supervised online learning problem has a non-trivial regret bound (and efficient).
