title: A Comparative Analysis and Study of Multiview CNN Models for Joint Object Categorization
  and Pose Estimation
abstract: In the Object Recognition task, there exists a dichotomy between the categorization
  of objects and estimating object pose, where the former necessitates a view-invariant
  representation, while the latter requires a representation capable of capturing
  pose information over different categories of objects. With the rise of deep architectures,
  the prime focus has been on object category recognition. Deep learning methods have
  achieved wide success in this task. In contrast, object pose estimation using these
  approaches has received relatively less attention. In this work, we study how Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNN) architectures can be adapted to the task of simultaneous object
  recognition and pose estimation. We investigate and analyze the layers of various
  CNN models and extensively compare between them with the goal of discovering how
  the layers of distributed representations within CNNs represent object pose information
  and how this contradicts with object category representations. We extensively experiment
  on two recent large and challenging multi-view datasets and we achieve better than
  the state-of-the-art.
