title: Diversity-Promoting Bayesian Learning of Latent Variable Models
abstract: In learning latent variable models (LVMs), it is important to effectively
  capture infrequent patterns and shrink model size without sacrificing modeling power.
  Various studies have been done to “diversify” a LVM, which aim to learn a diverse
  set of latent components in LVMs. Most existing studies fall into a frequentist-style
  regularization framework, where the components are learned via point estimation.
  In this paper, we investigate how to “diversify” LVMs in the paradigm of Bayesian
  learning, which has advantages complementary to point estimation, such as alleviating
  overfitting via model averaging and quantifying uncertainty. We propose two approaches
  that have complementary advantages. One is to define diversity-promoting mutual
  angular priors which assign larger density to components with larger mutual angles
  based on Bayesian network and von Mises-Fisher distribution and use these priors
  to affect the posterior via Bayes rule. We develop two efficient approximate posterior
  inference algorithms based on variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo
  sampling. The other approach is to impose diversity-promoting regularization directly
  over the post-data distribution of components. These two methods are applied to
  the Bayesian mixture of experts model to encourage the “experts” to be diverse and
  experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.
