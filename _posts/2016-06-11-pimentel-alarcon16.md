title: The Information-Theoretic Requirements of Subspace Clustering with Missing
  Data
abstract: Subspace clustering with missing data (SCMD) is a useful tool for analyzing
  incomplete datasets. Let d be the ambient dimension, and r the dimension of the
  subspaces. Existing theory shows that Nk = O(r d) columns per subspace are necessary
  for SCMD, and Nk =O(min d^(log d), d^(r+1) ) are sufficient. We close this gap,
  showing that Nk =O(r d) is also sufficient. To do this we derive deterministic sampling
  conditions for SCMD, which give precise information theoretic requirements and determine
  sampling regimes. These results explain the performance of SCMD algorithms from
  the literature. Finally, we give a practical algorithm to certify the output of
  any SCMD method deterministically.
