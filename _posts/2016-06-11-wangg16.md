title: Isotonic Hawkes Processes
abstract: Hawkes processes are powerful tools for modeling the mutual-excitation phenomena
  commonly observed in event data from a variety of domains, such as social networks,
  quantitative finance and healthcare records. The intensity function of a Hawkes
  process is typically assumed to be linear in the sum of triggering kernels, rendering
  it inadequate to capture nonlinear effects present in real-world data. To address
  this shortcoming, we propose an Isotonic-Hawkes process whose intensity function
  is modulated by an additional nonlinear link function. We also developed a novel
  iterative algorithm which learns both the nonlinear link function and other parameters
  provably. We showed that Isotonic-Hawkes processes can fit a variety of nonlinear
  patterns which cannot be captured by conventional Hawkes processes, and achieve
  superior empirical performance in real world applications.
