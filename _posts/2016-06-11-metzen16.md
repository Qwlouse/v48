title: Minimum Regret Search for Single- and Multi-Task Optimization
abstract: We propose minimum regret search (MRS), a novel acquisition function for
  Bayesian optimization. MRS bears similarities with information-theoretic approaches
  such as entropy search (ES). However, while ES aims in each query at maximizing
  the information gain with respect to the global maximum, MRS aims at minimizing
  the expected simple regret of its ultimate recommendation for the optimum. While
  empirically ES and MRS perform similar in most of the cases, MRS produces fewer
  outliers with high simple regret than ES. We provide empirical results both for
  a synthetic single-task optimization problem as well as for a simulated multi-task
  robotic control problem.
