title: 'SDNA: Stochastic Dual Newton Ascent for Empirical Risk Minimization'
abstract: 'We propose a new algorithm for minimizing regularized empirical loss: Stochastic
  Dual Newton Ascent (SDNA). Our method is dual in nature: in each iteration we update
  a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike existing methods such as
  stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of utilizing all local curvature
  information contained in the examples, which leads to striking improvements in both
  theory and practice â€“ sometimes by orders of magnitude. In the special case when
  an L2-regularizer is used in the primal, the dual problem is a concave quadratic
  maximization problem plus a separable term. In this regime, SDNA in each step solves
  a proximal subproblem involving a random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the
  quadratic function; whence the name of the method.'
