title: A ranking approach to global optimization
abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing an unknown function f over a compact
  and convex set using as few observations f(x) as possible. We observe that the optimization
  of the function f essentially relies on learning the induced bipartite ranking rule
  of f. Based on this idea, we relate global optimization to bipartite ranking which
  allows to address problems with high dimensional input space, as well as cases of
  functions with weak regularity properties. The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms
  for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method.
  Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences
  between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical
  evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically
  to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks.
