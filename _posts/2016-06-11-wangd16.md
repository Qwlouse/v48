title: Parallel and Distributed Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe Algorithms
abstract: We study parallel and distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms; the former on
  shared memory machines with mini-batching, and the latter in a delayed update framework.
  In both cases, we perform computations asynchronously whenever possible. We assume
  block-separable constraints as in Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) method (Lacoste
  et. al., 2013) , but our analysis subsumes BCFW and reveals problem-dependent quantities
  that govern the speedups of our methods over BCFW. A notable feature of our algorithms
  is that they do not depend on worst-case bounded delays, but only (mildly) on **expected**
  delays, making them robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads. We present experiments
  on structural SVM and Group Fused Lasso, and observe significant speedups over competing
  state-of-the-art (and synchronous) methods.
