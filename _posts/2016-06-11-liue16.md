title: 'Quadratic Optimization with Orthogonality Constraints: Explicit Lojasiewicz
  Exponent and Linear Convergence of Line-Search Methods'
abstract: A fundamental class of matrix optimization problems that arise in many areas
  of science and engineering is that of quadratic optimization with orthogonality
  constraints. Such problems can be solved using line-search methods on the Stiefel
  manifold, which are known to converge globally under mild conditions. To determine
  the convergence rates of these methods, we give an explicit estimate of the exponent
  in a Lojasiewicz inequality for the (non-convex) set of critical points of the aforementioned
  class of problems. This not only allows us to establish the linear convergence of
  a large class of line-search methods but also answers an important and intriguing
  problem in mathematical analysis and numerical optimization. A key step in our proof
  is to establish a local error bound for the set of critical points, which may be
  of independent interest.
