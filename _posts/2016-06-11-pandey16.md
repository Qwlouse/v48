title: On collapsed representation of hierarchical Completely Random Measures
abstract: The aim of the paper is to provide an exact approach for generating a Poisson
  process sampled from a hierarchical CRM, without having to instantiate the infinitely
  many atoms of the random measures. We use completely random measuresÂ (CRM) and hierarchical
  CRM to define a prior for Poisson processes. We derive the marginal distribution
  of the resultant point process, when the underlying CRM is marginalized out. Using
  well known properties unique to Poisson processes, we were able to derive an exact
  approach for instantiating a Poisson process with a hierarchical CRM prior. Furthermore,
  we derive Gibbs sampling strategies for hierarchical CRM models based on Chinese
  restaurant franchise sampling scheme. As an example, we present the sum of generalized
  gamma process (SGGP), and show its application in topic-modelling. We show that
  one can determine the power-law behaviour of the topics and words in a Bayesian
  fashion, by defining a prior on the parameters of SGGP.
