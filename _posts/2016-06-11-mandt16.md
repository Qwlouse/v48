title: A Variational Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Algorithms
abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an important algorithm in machine learning.
  With constant learning rates, it is a stochastic process that, after an initial
  phase of convergence, generates samples from a stationary distribution. We show
  that SGD with constant rates can be effectively used as an approximate posterior
  inference algorithm for probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we show how to adjust
  the tuning parameters of SGD such as to match the resulting stationary distribution
  to the posterior. This analysis rests on interpreting SGD as a continuous-time stochastic
  process and then minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between its stationary
  distribution and the target posterior. (This is in the spirit of variational inference.)
  In more detail, we model SGD as a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and then
  use properties of this process to derive the optimal parameters. This theoretical
  framework also connects SGD to modern scalable inference algorithms; we analyze
  the recently proposed stochastic gradient Fisher scoring under this perspective.
  We demonstrate that SGD with properly chosen constant rates gives a new way to optimize
  hyperparameters in probabilistic models.
