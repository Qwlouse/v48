title: Hawkes Processes with Stochastic Excitations
abstract: We propose an extension to Hawkes processes by treating the levels of self-excitation
  as a stochastic differential equation. Our new point process allows better approximation
  in application domains where events and intensities accelerate each other with correlated
  levels of contagion. We generalize a recent algorithm for simulating draws from
  Hawkes processes whose levels of excitation are stochastic processes, and propose
  a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo approach for model fitting. Our sampling procedure
  scales linearly with the number of required events and does not require stationarity
  of the point process. A modular inference procedure consisting of a combination
  between Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings steps is put forward. We recover expectation
  maximization as a special case. Our general approach is illustrated for contagion
  following geometric Brownian motion and exponential Langevin dynamics.
