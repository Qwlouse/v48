title: Factored Temporal Sigmoid Belief Networks for Sequence Learning
abstract: Deep conditional generative models are developed to simultaneously learn
  the temporal dependencies of multiple sequences. The model is designed by introducing
  a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicative interactions between side
  information and sequences. The proposed model builds on the Temporal Sigmoid Belief
  Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBNs). The transition
  matrices are further factored to reduce the number of parameters and improve generalization.
  When side information is not available, a general framework for semi-supervised
  learning based on the proposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification.
  Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive
  and classification performance on sequential data, and has the capacity to synthesize
  sequences, with controlled style transitioning and blending.
