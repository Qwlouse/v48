title: Partition Functions from Rao-Blackwellized Tempered Sampling
abstract: Partition functions of probability distributions are important quantities
  for model evaluation and comparisons. We present a new method to compute partition
  functions of complex and multimodal distributions. Such distributions are often
  sampled using simulated tempering, which augments the target space with an auxiliary
  inverse temperature variable. Our method exploits the multinomial probability law
  of the inverse temperatures, and provides estimates of the partition function in
  terms of a simple quotient of Rao-Blackwellized marginal inverse temperature probability
  estimates, which are updated while sampling. We show that the method has interesting
  connections with several alternative popular methods, and offers some significant
  advantages. In particular, we empirically find that the new method provides more
  accurate estimates than Annealed Importance Sampling when calculating partition
  functions of large Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM); moreover, the method is
  sufficiently accurate to track training and validation log-likelihoods during learning
  of RBMs, at minimal computational cost.
