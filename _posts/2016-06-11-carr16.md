title: 'BASC: Applying Bayesian Optimization to the Search for Global Minima on Potential
  Energy Surfaces'
abstract: 'We present a novel application of Bayesian optimization to the field of
  surface science: rapidly and accurately searching for the global minimum on potential
  energy surfaces. Controlling molecule-surface interactions is key for applications
  ranging from environmental catalysis to gas sensing. We present pragmatic techniques,
  including exploration/exploitation scheduling and a custom covariance kernel that
  encodes the properties of our objective function. Our method, the Bayesian Active
  Site Calculator (BASC), outperforms differential evolution and constrained minima
  hopping – two state-of-the-art approaches – in trial examples of carbon monoxide
  adsorption on a hematite substrate, both with and without a defect.'
