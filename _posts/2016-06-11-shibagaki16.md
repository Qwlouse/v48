title: Simultaneous Safe Screening of Features and Samples in Doubly Sparse Modeling
abstract: The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the
  process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over
  them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of non-active
  features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for
  feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach
  for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating
  feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them
  simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the
  sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for
  improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first
  theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical
  advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers
  of features and samples.
