title: 'Low-rank tensor completion: a Riemannian manifold preconditioning approach'
abstract: We propose a novel Riemannian manifold preconditioning approach for the
  tensor completion problem with rank constraint. A novel Riemannian metric or inner
  product is proposed that exploits the least-squares structure of the cost function
  and takes into account the structured symmetry that exists in Tucker decomposition.
  The specific metric allows to use the versatile framework of Riemannian optimization
  on quotient manifolds to develop preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient and
  stochastic gradient descent algorithms in batch and online setups, respectively.
  Concrete matrix representations of various optimization-related ingredients are
  listed. Numerical comparisons suggest that our proposed algorithms robustly outperform
  state-of-the-art algorithms across different synthetic and real-world datasets.
