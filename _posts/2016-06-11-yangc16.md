title: 'Sparse Nonlinear Regression: Parameter Estimation under Nonconvexity'
abstract: We study parameter estimation for sparse nonlinear regression. More specifically,
  we assume the data are given by y = f( \bf x^T \bf β^* ) + ε, where f is nonlinear.
  To recover \bf βs, we propose an \ell_1-regularized least-squares estimator. Unlike
  classical linear regression, the corresponding optimization problem is nonconvex
  because of the nonlinearity of f. In spite of the nonconvexity, we prove that under
  mild conditions, every stationary point of the objective enjoys an optimal statistical
  rate of convergence. Detailed numerical results are provided to back up our theory.
