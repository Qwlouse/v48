title: Experimental Design on a Budget for Sparse Linear Models and Applications
abstract: 'Budget constrained optimal design of experiments is a classical problem
  in statistics. Although the optimal design literature is very mature, few efficient
  strategies are available when these design problems appear in the context of sparse
  linear models commonly encountered in high dimensional machine learning and statistics.
  In this work, we study experimental design for the setting where the underlying
  regression model is characterized by a \ell_1-regularized linear function. We propose
  two novel strategies: the first is motivated geometrically whereas the second is
  algebraic in nature. We obtain tractable algorithms for this problem and also hold
  for a more general class of sparse linear models. We perform an extensive set of
  experiments, on benchmarks and a large multi-site neuroscience study, showing that
  the proposed models are effective in practice. The latter experiment suggests that
  these ideas may play a small role in informing enrollment strategies for similar
  scientific studies in the short-to-medium term future.'
