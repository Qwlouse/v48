title: Structure Learning of Partitioned Markov Networks
abstract: We learn the structure of a Markov Network between two groups of random
  variables from joint observations. Since modelling and learning the full MN structure
  may be hard, learning the links between two groups directly may be a preferable
  option. We introduce a novel concept called the \emphpartitioned ratio whose factorization
  directly associates with the Markovian properties of random variables across two
  groups. A simple one-shot convex optimization procedure is proposed for learning
  the \emphsparse factorizations of the partitioned ratio and it is theoretically
  guaranteed to recover the correct inter-group structure under mild conditions. The
  performance of the proposed method is experimentally compared with the state of
  the art MN structure learning methods using ROC curves. Real applications on analyzing
  bipartisanship in US congress and pairwise DNA/time-series alignments are also reported.
