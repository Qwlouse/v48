title: Pricing a Low-regret Seller
abstract: 'As the number of ad exchanges has grown, publishers have turned to low
  regret learning algorithms to decide which exchange offers the best price for their
  inventory. This in turn opens the following question for the exchange: how to set
  prices to attract as many sellers as possible and maximize revenue. In this work
  we formulate this precisely as a learning problem, and present algorithms showing
  that by simply knowing that the counterparty is using a low regret algorithm is
  enough for the exchange to have its own low regret learning algorithm to find the
  optimal price.'
