title: Interacting Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo
abstract: We introduce interacting particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (iPMCMC), a PMCMC
  method based on an interacting pool of standard and conditional sequential Monte
  Carlo samplers. Like related methods, iPMCMC is a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler
  on an extended space. We present empirical results that show significant improvements
  in mixing rates relative to both non-interacting PMCMC samplers and a single PMCMC
  sampler with an equivalent memory and computational budget. An additional advantage
  of the iPMCMC method is that it is suitable for distributed and multi-core architectures.
