title: Augmenting Supervised Neural Networks with Unsupervised Objectives for Large-scale
  Image Classification
abstract: Unsupervised learning and supervised learning are key research topics in
  deep learning. However, as high-capacity supervised neural networks trained with
  a large amount of labels have achieved remarkable success in many computer vision
  tasks, the availability of large-scale labeled images reduced the significance of
  unsupervised learning. Inspired by the recent trend toward revisiting the importance
  of unsupervised learning, we investigate joint supervised and unsupervised learning
  in a large-scale setting by augmenting existing neural networks with decoding pathways
  for reconstruction. First, we demonstrate that the intermediate activations of pretrained
  large-scale classification networks preserve almost all the information of input
  images except a portion of local spatial details. Then, by end-to-end training of
  the entire augmented architecture with the reconstructive objective, we show improvement
  of the network performance for supervised tasks. We evaluate several variants of
  autoencoders, including the recently proposed â€œwhat-where" autoencoder that uses
  the encoder pooling switches, to study the importance of the architecture design.
  Taking the 16-layer VGGNet trained under the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 protocol as a
  strong baseline for image classification, our methods improve the validation-set
  accuracy by a noticeable margin.
