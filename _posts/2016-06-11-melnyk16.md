title: Estimating Structured Vector Autoregressive Models
abstract: While considerable advances have been made in estimating high-dimensional
  structured models from independent data using Lasso-type models, limited progress
  has been made for settings when the samples are dependent. We consider estimating
  structured VAR (vector auto-regressive model), where the structure can be captured
  by any suitable norm, e.g., Lasso, group Lasso, order weighted Lasso, etc. In VAR
  setting with correlated noise, although there is strong dependence over time and
  covariates, we establish bounds on the non-asymptotic estimation error of structured
  VAR parameters. The estimation error is of the same order as that of the corresponding
  Lasso-type estimator with independent samples, and the analysis holds for any norm.
  Our analysis relies on results in generic chaining, sub-exponential martingales,
  and spectral representation of VAR models. Experimental results on synthetic and
  real data with a variety of structures are presented, validating theoretical results.
