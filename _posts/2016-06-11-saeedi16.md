title: 'The Segmented iHMM: A Simple, Efficient Hierarchical Infinite HMM'
abstract: We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov
  model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well
  suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a
  time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional
  iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing
  between high-and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but
  they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains
  the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation
  problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated
  HHMM.
