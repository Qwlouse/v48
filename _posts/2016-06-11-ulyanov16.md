title: 'Texture Networks: Feed-forward Synthesis of Textures and Stylized Images'
abstract: Gatys et al. recently demonstrated that deep networks can generate beautiful
  textures and stylized images from a single texture example. However, their methods
  requires a slow and memory-consuming optimization process. We propose here an alternative
  approach that moves the computational burden to a learning stage. Given a single
  example of a texture, our approach trains compact feed-forward convolutional networks
  to generate multiple samples of the same texture of arbitrary size and to transfer
  artistic style from a given image to any other image. The resulting networks are
  remarkably light-weight and can generate textures of quality comparable to Gatys
  et al., but hundreds of times faster. More generally, our approach highlights the
  power and flexibility of generative feed-forward models trained with complex and
  expressive loss functions.
