title: 'Learning from Multiway Data: Simple and Efficient Tensor Regression'
abstract: Tensor regression has shown to be advantageous in learning tasks with multi-directional
  relatedness. Given massive multiway data, traditional methods are often too slow
  to operate on or suffer from memory bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce subsampled
  tensor projected gradient to solve the problem. Our algorithm is impressively simple
  and efficient. It is built upon projected gradient method with fast tensor power
  iterations, leveraging randomized sketching for further acceleration. Theoretical
  analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the correct solution in fixed number
  of iterations. The memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the problem.
  We demonstrate superior empirical performance on both multi-linear multi-task learning
  and spatio-temporal applications.
