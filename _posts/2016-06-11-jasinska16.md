title: Extreme F-measure Maximization using Sparse Probability Estimates
abstract: We consider the problem of (macro) F-measure maximization in the context
  of extreme multi-label classification (XMLC), i.e., multi-label classification with
  extremely large label spaces. We investigate several approaches based on recent
  results on the maximization of complex performance measures in binary classification.
  According to these results, the F-measure can be maximized by properly thresholding
  conditional class probability estimates. We show that a naive adaptation of this
  approach can be very costly for XMLC and propose to solve the problem by classifiers
  that efficiently deliver sparse probability estimates (SPEs), that is, probability
  estimates restricted to the most probable labels. Empirical results provide evidence
  for the strong practical performance of this approach.
