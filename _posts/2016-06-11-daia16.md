title: The knockoff filter for FDR control in group-sparse and multitask regression
abstract: We propose the group knockoff filter, a method for false discovery rate
  control in a linear regression setting where the features are grouped, and we would
  like to select a set of relevant groups which have a nonzero effect on the response.
  By considering the set of true and false discoveries at the group level, this method
  gains power relative to sparse regression methods. We also apply our method to the
  multitask regression problem where multiple response variables share similar sparsity
  patterns across the set of possible features. Empirically, the group knockoff filter
  successfully controls false discoveries at the group level in both settings, with
  substantially more discoveries made by leveraging the group structure.
