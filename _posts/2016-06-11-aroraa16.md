title: Stochastic Optimization for Multiview Representation Learning using Partial
  Least Squares
abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a ubiquitous statistical technique for bilinear
  factor analysis. It is used in many data analysis, machine learning, and information
  retrieval applications to model the covariance structure between a pair of data
  matrices. In this paper, we consider PLS for representation learning in a multiview
  setting where we have more than one view in data at training time. Furthermore,
  instead of framing PLS as a problem about a fixed given data set, we argue that
  PLS should be studied as a stochastic optimization problem, especially in a "big
  data" setting, with the goal of optimizing a population objective based on sample.
  This view suggests using Stochastic Approximation (SA) approaches, such as Stochastic
  Gradient Descent (SGD) and enables a rigorous analysis of their benefits. In this
  paper, we develop SA approaches to PLS and provide iteration complexity bounds for
  the proposed algorithms.
