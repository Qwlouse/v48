title: A Simple and Provable Algorithm for Sparse Diagonal CCA
abstract: Given two sets of variables, derived from a common set of samples, sparse
  Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) seeks linear combinations of a small number
  of variables in each set, such that the induced \emphcanonical variables are maximally
  correlated. Sparse CCA is NP-hard. We propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for
  sparse diagonal CCA, \textiti.e., sparse CCA under the additional assumption that
  variables within each set are standardized and uncorrelated. Our algorithm operates
  on a low rank approximation of the input data and its computational complexity scales
  linearly with the number of input variables. It is simple to implement, and parallelizable.
  In contrast to most existing approaches, our algorithm administers precise control
  on the sparsity of the extracted canonical vectors, and comes with theoretical data-dependent
  global approximation guarantees, that hinge on the spectrum of the input data. Finally,
  it can be straightforwardly adapted to other constrained variants of CCA enforcing
  structure beyond sparsity. We empirically evaluate the proposed scheme and apply
  it on a real neuroimaging dataset to investigate associations between brain activity
  and behavior measurements.
