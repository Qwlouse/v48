title: Automatic Construction of Nonparametric Relational Regression Models for Multiple
  Time Series
abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a general and analytically tractable way
  of modeling complex time-varying, nonparametric functions. The Automatic Bayesian
  Covariance Discovery (ABCD) system constructs natural-language description of time-series
  data by treating unknown time-series data nonparametrically using GP with a composite
  covariance kernel function. Unfortunately, learning a composite covariance kernel
  with a single time-series data set often results in less informative kernel that
  may not give qualitative, distinctive descriptions of data. We address this challenge
  by proposing two relational kernel learning methods which can model multiple time-series
  data sets by finding common, shared causes of changes. We show that the relational
  kernel learning methods find more accurate models for regression problems on several
  real-world data sets; US stock data, US house price index data and currency exchange
  rate data.
