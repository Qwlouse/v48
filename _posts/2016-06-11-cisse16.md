title: 'ADIOS: Architectures Deep In Output Space'
abstract: Multi-label classification is a generalization of binary classification
  where the task consists in predicting \emphsets of labels. With the availability
  of ever larger datasets, the multi-label setting has become a natural one in many
  applications, and the interest in solving multi-label problems has grown significantly.
  As expected, deep learning approaches are now yielding state-of-the-art performance
  for this class of problems. Unfortunately, they usually do not take into account
  the often unknown but nevertheless rich relationships between labels. In this paper,
  we propose to make use of this underlying structure by learning to partition the
  labels into a Markov Blanket Chain and then applying a novel deep architecture that
  exploits the partition. Experiments on several popular and large multi-label datasets
  demonstrate that our approach not only yields significant improvements, but also
  helps to overcome trade-offs specific to the multi-label classification setting.
