title: A Kernel Test of Goodness of Fit
abstract: 'We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given
  a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated
  from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed
  via Steinâ€™s method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our
  test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the
  form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the
  kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where
  we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We
  apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity
  in nonparametric density estimation.'
