title: 'Greedy Column Subset Selection: New Bounds and Distributed Algorithms'
abstract: The problem of column subset selection has recently attracted a large body
  of research, with feature selection serving as one obvious and important application.
  Among the techniques that have been applied to solve this problem, the greedy algorithm
  has been shown to be quite effective in practice. However, theoretical guarantees
  on its performance have not been explored thoroughly, especially in a distributed
  setting. In this paper, we study the greedy algorithm for the column subset selection
  problem from a theoretical and empirical perspective and show its effectiveness
  in a distributed setting. In particular, we provide an improved approximation guarantee
  for the greedy algorithm which we show is tight up to a constant factor, and present
  the first distributed implementation with provable approximation factors. We use
  the idea of randomized composable core-sets, developed recently in the context of
  submodular maximization. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of this distributed
  algorithm via an empirical study.
