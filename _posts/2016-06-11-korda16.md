title: Distributed Clustering of Linear Bandits in Peer to Peer Networks
abstract: We provide two distributed confidence ball algorithms for solving linear
  bandit problems in peer to peer networks with limited communication capabilities.
  For the first, we assume that all the peers are solving the same linear bandit problem,
  and prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal asymptotic regret rate of any
  centralised algorithm that can instantly communicate information between the peers.
  For the second, we assume that there are clusters of peers solving the same bandit
  problem within each cluster, and we prove that our algorithm discovers these clusters,
  while achieving the optimal asymptotic regret rate within each one. Through experiments
  on several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms
  compared to the state-of-the-art.
