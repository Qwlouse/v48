title: Dynamic Memory Networks for Visual and Textual Question Answering
abstract: Neural network architectures with memory and attention mechanisms exhibit
  certain reason- ing capabilities required for question answering. One such architecture,
  the dynamic memory net- work (DMN), obtained high accuracy on a variety of language
  tasks. However, it was not shown whether the architecture achieves strong results
  for question answering when supporting facts are not marked during training or whether
  it could be applied to other modalities such as images. Based on an analysis of
  the DMN, we propose several improvements to its memory and input modules. Together
  with these changes we introduce a novel input module for images in order to be able
  to answer visual questions. Our new DMN+ model improves the state of the art on
  both the Visual Question Answering dataset and the bAbI-10k text question-answering
  dataset without supporting fact supervision.
