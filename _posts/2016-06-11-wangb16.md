title: The Knowledge Gradient for Sequential Decision Making with Stochastic Binary
  Feedbacks
abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially making decisions that are rewarded
  by “successes” and “failures” which can be predicted through an unknown relationship
  that depends on a partially controllable vector of attributes for each instance.
  The learner takes an active role in selecting samples from the instance pool. The
  goal is to maximize the probability of success, either after the offline training
  phase or minimizing regret in online learning. Our problem is motivated by real-world
  applications where observations are time consuming and/or expensive. With the adaptation
  of an online Bayesian linear classifier, we develop a knowledge-gradient type policy
  to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling
  each alternative, in order to reduce the number of expensive physical experiments.
  We provide a finite-time analysis of the estimated error and demonstrate the performance
  of the proposed algorithm on both synthetic problems and benchmark UCI datasets.
