title: Variable Elimination in the Fourier Domain
abstract: The ability to represent complex high dimensional probability distributions
  in a compact form is one of the key insights in the field of graphical models. Factored
  representations are ubiquitous in machine learning and lead to major computational
  advantages. We explore a different type of compact representation based on discrete
  Fourier representations, complementing the classical approach based on conditional
  independencies. We show that a large class of probabilistic graphical models have
  a compact Fourier representation. This theoretical result opens up an entirely new
  way of approximating a probability distribution. We demonstrate the significance
  of this approach by applying it to the variable elimination algorithm. Compared
  with the traditional bucket representation and other approximate inference algorithms,
  we obtain significant improvements.
