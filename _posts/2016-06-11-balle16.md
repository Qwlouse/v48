title: Differentially Private Policy Evaluation
abstract: We present the first differentially private algorithms for reinforcement
  learning, which apply to the task of evaluating a fixed policy. We establish two
  approaches for achieving differential privacy, provide a theoretical analysis of
  the privacy and utility of the two algorithms, and show promising results on simple
  empirical examples.
