title: Parameter Estimation for Generalized Thurstone Choice Models
abstract: We consider the maximum likelihood parameter estimation problem for a generalized
  Thurstone choice model, where choices are from comparison sets of two or more items.
  We provide tight characterizations of the mean square error, as well as necessary
  and sufficient conditions for correct classification when each item belongs to one
  of two classes. These results provide insights into how the estimation accuracy
  depends on the choice of a generalized Thurstone choice model and the structure
  of comparison sets. We find that for a priori unbiased structures of comparisons,
  e.g., when comparison sets are drawn independently and uniformly at random, the
  number of observations needed to achieve a prescribed estimation accuracy depends
  on the choice of a generalized Thurstone choice model. For a broad set of generalized
  Thurstone choice models, which includes all popular instances used in practice,
  the estimation error is shown to be largely insensitive to the cardinality of comparison
  sets. On the other hand, we found that there exist generalized Thurstone choice
  models for which the estimation error decreases much faster with the cardinality
  of comparison sets.
