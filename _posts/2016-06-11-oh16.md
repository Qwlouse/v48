title: Control of Memory, Active Perception, and Action in Minecraft
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new set of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks
  in Minecraft (a flexible 3D world). We then use these tasks to systematically compare
  and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectures with our new
  memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed to emphasize, in a controllable
  manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methods including partial observability
  (due to first-person visual observations), delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual
  observations, and the need to use active perception in a correct manner so as to
  perform well in the tasks. While these tasks are conceptually simple to describe,
  by virtue of having all of these challenges simultaneously they are difficult for
  current DRL architectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance
  of the architectures on environments not used during training. The experimental
  results show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environments better
  than existing DRL architectures.
