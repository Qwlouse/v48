title: Stochastic Discrete Clenshaw-Curtis Quadrature
abstract: The partition function is fundamental for probabilistic graphical modelsâ€”it
  is required for inference, parameter estimation, and model selection. Evaluating
  this function corresponds to discrete integration, namely a weighted sum over an
  exponentially large set. This task quickly becomes intractable as the dimensionality
  of the problem increases. We propose an approximation scheme that, for any discrete
  graphical model whose parameter vector has bounded norm, estimates the partition
  function with arbitrarily small error. Our algorithm relies on a near minimax optimal
  polynomial approximation to the potential function and a Clenshaw-Curtis style quadrature.
  Furthermore, we show that this algorithm can be randomized to split the computation
  into a high-complexity part and a low-complexity part, where the latter may be carried
  out on small computational devices. Experiments confirm that the new randomized
  algorithm is highly accurate if the parameter norm is small, and is otherwise comparable
  to methods with unbounded error.
