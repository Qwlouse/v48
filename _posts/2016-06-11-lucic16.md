title: Horizontally Scalable Submodular Maximization
abstract: 'A variety of large-scale machine learning problems can be cast as instances
  of constrained submodular maximization. Existing approaches for distributed submodular
  maximization have a critical drawback: The capacity - number of instances that can
  fit in memory - must grow with the data set size. In practice, while one can provision
  many machines, the capacity of each machine is limited by physical constraints.
  We propose a truly scalable approach for distributed submodular maximization under
  fixed capacity. The proposed framework applies to a broad class of algorithms and
  constraints and provides theoretical guarantees on the approximation factor for
  any available capacity. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm on a variety
  of data sets and demonstrate that it achieves performance competitive with the centralized
  greedy solution.'
