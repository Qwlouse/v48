title: Epigraph projections for fast general convex programming
abstract: This paper develops an approach for efficiently solving general convex optimization
  problems specified as disciplined convex programs (DCP), a common general-purpose
  modeling framework. Specifically we develop an algorithm based upon fast epigraph
  projections, projections onto the epigraph of a convex function, an approach closely
  linked to proximal operator methods. We show that by using these operators, we can
  solve any disciplined convex program without transforming the problem to a standard
  cone form, as is done by current DCP libraries. We then develop a large library
  of efficient epigraph projection operators, mirroring and extending work on fast
  proximal algorithms, for many common convex functions. Finally, we evaluate the
  performance of the algorithm, and show it often achieves order of magnitude speedups
  over existing general-purpose optimization solvers.
