title: Learning Representations for Counterfactual Inference
abstract: Observational studies are rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation
  of data in fields such as healthcare, education, employment and ecology. We consider
  the task of answering counterfactual questions such as, â€œWould this patient have
  lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?". We propose a new algorithmic
  framework for counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation
  and representation learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform
  an empirical comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational
  data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.
