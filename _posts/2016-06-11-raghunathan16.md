title: Estimation from Indirect Supervision with Linear Moments
abstract: 'In structured prediction problems where we have indirect supervision of
  the output, maximum marginal likelihood faces two computational obstacles: non-convexity
  of the objective and intractability of even a single gradient computation. In this
  paper, we bypass both obstacles for a class of what we call linear indirectly-supervised
  problems. Our approach is simple: we solve a linear system to estimate sufficient
  statistics of the model, which we then use to estimate parameters via convex optimization.
  We analyze the statistical properties of our approach and show empirically that
  it is effective in two settings: learning with local privacy constraints and learning
  from low-cost count-based annotations.'
