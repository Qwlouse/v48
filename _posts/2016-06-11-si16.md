title: Computationally Efficient Nyström Approximation using Fast Transforms
abstract: Our goal is to improve the \it training and \it prediction time of Nyström
  method, which is a widely-used technique for generating low-rank kernel matrix approximations.
  When applying the Nyström approximation for large-scale applications, both training
  and prediction time is dominated by computing kernel values between a data point
  and all landmark points. With m landmark points, this computation requires Θ(md)
  time (flops), where d is the input dimension. In this paper, we propose the use
  of a family of fast transforms to generate structured landmark points for Nyström
  approximation. By exploiting fast transforms, e.g., Haar transform and Hadamard
  transform, our modified Nyström method requires only Θ(m) or Θ(m\log d) time to
  compute the kernel values between a given data point and m landmark points. This
  improvement in time complexity can significantly speed up kernel approximation and
  benefit prediction speed in kernel machines. For instance, on the webspam data (more
  than 300,000 data points), our proposed algorithm enables kernel SVM prediction
  to deliver 98% accuracy and the resulting prediction time is 1000 times faster than
  LIBSVM and only 10 times slower than linear SVM prediction (which yields only 91%
  accuracy).
