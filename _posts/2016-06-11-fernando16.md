title: Learning End-to-end Video Classification with Rank-Pooling
abstract: We introduce a new model for representation learning and classification
  of video sequences. Our model is based on a convolutional neural network coupled
  with a novel temporal pooling layer. The temporal pooling layer relies on an inner-optimization
  problem to efficiently encode temporal semantics over arbitrarily long video clips
  into a fixed-length vector representation. Importantly, the representation and classification
  parameters of our model can be estimated jointly in an end-to-end manner by formulating
  learning as a bilevel optimization problem. Furthermore, the model can make use
  of any existing convolutional neural network architecture (e.g., AlexNet or VGG)
  without modification or introduction of additional parameters. We demonstrate our
  approach on action and activity recognition tasks.
