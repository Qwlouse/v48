title: Interactive Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering
abstract: Clustering is a powerful tool in data analysis, but it is often difficult
  to find a grouping that aligns with a userâ€™s needs. To address this, several methods
  incorporate constraints obtained from users into clustering algorithms, but unfortunately
  do not apply to hierarchical clustering. We design an interactive Bayesian algorithm
  that incorporates user interaction into hierarchical clustering while still utilizing
  the geometry of the data by sampling a constrained posterior distribution over hierarchies.
  We also suggest several ways to intelligently query a user. The algorithm, along
  with the querying schemes, shows promising results on real data.
