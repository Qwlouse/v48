title: Sparse Parameter Recovery from Aggregated Data
abstract: Data aggregation is becoming an increasingly common technique for sharing
  sensitive information, and for reducing data size when storage and/or communication
  costs are high. Aggregate quantities such as group-average are a form of semi-supervision
  as they do not directly provide information of individual values, but despite their
  wide-spread use, prior literature on learning individual-level models from aggregated
  data is extremely limited. This paper investigates the effect of data aggregation
  on parameter recovery for a sparse linear model, when known results are no longer
  applicable. In particular, we consider a scenario where the data are collected into
  groups e.g. aggregated patient records, and first-order empirical moments are available
  only at the group level. Despite this obfuscation of individual data values, we
  can show that the true parameter is recoverable with high probability using these
  aggregates when the collection of true group moments is an incoherent matrix, and
  the empirical moment estimates have been computed from a sufficiently large number
  of samples. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first results on structured
  parameter recovery using only aggregated data. Experimental results on synthetic
  data are provided in support of these theoretical claims. We also show that parameter
  estimation from aggregated data approaches the accuracy of parameter estimation
  obtainable from non-aggregated or â€œindividual" samples, when applied to two real
  world healthcare applications- predictive modeling of CMS Medicare reimbursement
  claims, and modeling of Texas State healthcare charges.
