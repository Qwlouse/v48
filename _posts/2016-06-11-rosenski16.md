title: Multi-Player Bandits â€“ a Musical Chairs Approach
abstract: We consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, where
  multiple players simultaneously choose from the same set of arms and may collide,
  receiving no reward. This setting has been motivated by problems arising in cognitive
  radio networks, and is especially challenging under the realistic assumption that
  communication between players is limited. We provide a communication-free algorithm
  (Musical Chairs) which attains constant regret with high probability, as well as
  a sublinear-regret, communication-free algorithm (Dynamic Musical Chairs) for the
  more difficult setting of players dynamically entering and leaving throughout the
  game. Moreover, both algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the number of
  players. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first communication-free algorithms
  with these types of formal guarantees.
