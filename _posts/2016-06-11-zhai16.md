title: Deep Structured Energy Based Models for Anomaly Detection
abstract: 'In this paper, we attack the anomaly detection problem by directly modeling
  the data distribution with deep architectures. We hence propose deep structured
  energy based models (DSEBMs), where the energy function is the output of a deterministic
  deep neural network with structure. We develop novel model architectures to integrate
  EBMs with different types of data such as static data, sequential data, and spatial
  data, and apply appropriate model architectures to adapt to the data structure.
  Our training algorithm is built upon the recent development of score matching (Hyvarinen,
  2005), which connects an EBM with a regularized autoencoder, eliminating the need
  for complicated sampling method. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived
  for anomaly detection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the
  data distribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomaly detection:
  the energy score and the reconstruction error. Extensive empirical studies on benchmark
  anomaly detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed model consistently matches
  or outperforms all the competing methods.'
