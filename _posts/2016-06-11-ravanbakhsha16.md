title: Boolean Matrix Factorization and Noisy Completion via Message Passing
abstract: Boolean matrix factorization and Boolean matrix completion from noisy observations
  are desirable unsupervised data-analysis methods due to their interpretability,
  but hard to perform due to their NP-hardness. We treat these problems as maximum
  a posteriori inference problems in a graphical model and present a message passing
  approach that scales linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical
  study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices,
  in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and compares favorably with
  state-of-the-art in real-world applications, such collaborative filtering with large-scale
  Boolean data.
