title: A Random Matrix Approach to Echo-State Neural Networks
abstract: Recurrent neural networks, especially in their linear version, have provided
  many qualitative insights on their performance under different configurations. This
  article provides, through a novel random matrix framework, the quantitative counterpart
  of these performance results, specifically in the case of echo-state networks. Beyond
  mere insights, our approach conveys a deeper understanding on the core mechanism
  under play for both training and testing.
