title: Estimating Cosmological Parameters from the Dark Matter Distribution
abstract: A grand challenge of the 21st century cosmology is to accurately estimate
  the cosmological parameters of our Universe. A major approach in estimating the
  cosmological parameters is to use the large scale matter distribution of the Universe.
  Galaxy surveys provide the means to map out cosmic large-scale structure in three
  dimensions. Information about galaxy locations is typically summarized in a "single"
  function of scale, such as the galaxy correlation function or power-spectrum. We
  show that it is possible to estimate these cosmological parameters directly from
  the distribution of matter. This paper presents the application of deep 3D convolutional
  networks to volumetric representation of dark matter simulations as well as the
  results obtained using a recently proposed distribution regression framework, showing
  that machine learning techniques are comparable to, and can sometimes outperform,
  maximum-likelihood point estimates using "cosmological models". This opens the way
  to estimating the parameters of our Universe with higher accuracy.
