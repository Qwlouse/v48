title: Slice Sampling on Hamiltonian Trajectories
abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and slice sampling are amongst the most widely used
  and studied classes of Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. We connect these two methods
  and present Hamiltonian slice sampling, which allows slice sampling to be carried
  out along Hamiltonian trajectories, or transformations thereof. Hamiltonian slice
  sampling clarifies a class of model priors that induce closed-form slice samplers.
  More pragmatically, inheriting properties of slice samplers, it offers advantages
  over Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, in that it has fewer tunable hyperparameters and does
  not require gradient information. We demonstrate the utility of Hamiltonian slice
  sampling out of the box on problems ranging from Gaussian process regression to
  Pitman-Yor based mixture models.
