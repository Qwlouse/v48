title: Algorithms for Optimizing the Ratio of Submodular Functions
abstract: We investigate a new optimization problem involving minimizing the Ratio
  of Submodular (RS) functions. We argue that this problem occurs naturally in several
  real world applications. We then show the connection between this problem and several
  related problems, including minimizing the difference of submodular functions, and
  to submodular optimization subject to submodular constraints. We show RS that optimization
  can be solved within bounded approximation factors. We also provide a hardness bound
  and show that our tightest algorithm matches the lower bound up to a \log factor.
  Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties
  of our algorithms.
