title: Learning Sparse Combinatorial Representations via Two-stage Submodular Maximization
abstract: We consider the problem of learning sparse representations of data sets,
  where the goal is to reduce a data set in manner that optimizes multiple objectives.
  Motivated by applications of data summarization, we develop a new model which we
  refer to as the two-stage submodular maximization problem. This task can be viewed
  as a combinatorial analogue of representation learning problems such as dictionary
  learning and sparse regression. The two-stage problem strictly generalizes the problem
  of cardinality constrained submodular maximization, though the objective function
  is not submodular and the techniques for submodular maximization cannot be applied.
  We describe a continuous optimization method which achieves an approximation ratio
  which asymptotically approaches 1-1/e. For instances where the asymptotics do not
  kick in, we design a local-search algorithm whose approximation ratio is arbitrarily
  close to 1/2. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on two
  multi-objective data summarization tasks, where the goal is to construct summaries
  via sparse representative subsets w.r.t. to predefined objectives.
