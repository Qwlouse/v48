title: Minding the Gaps for Block Frank-Wolfe Optimization of Structured SVMs
abstract: In this paper, we propose several improvements on the block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe
  (BCFW) algorithm from Lacoste-Julien et al. (2013) recently used to optimize the
  structured support vector machine (SSVM) objective in the context of structured
  prediction, though it has wider applications. The key intuition behind our improvements
  is that the estimates of block gaps maintained by BCFW reveal the block suboptimality
  that can be used as an *adaptive* criterion. First, we sample objects at each iteration
  of BCFW in an adaptive non-uniform way via gap-based sampling. Second, we incorporate
  pairwise and away-step variants of Frank-Wolfe into the block-coordinate setting.
  Third, we cache oracle calls with a cache-hit criterion based on the block gaps.
  Fourth, we provide the first method to compute an approximate regularization path
  for SSVM. Finally, we provide an exhaustive empirical evaluation of all our methods
  on four structured prediction datasets.
