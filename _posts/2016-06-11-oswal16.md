title: Representational Similarity Learning with Application to Brain Networks
abstract: Representational Similarity Learning (RSL) aims to discover features that
  are important in representing (human-judged) similarities among objects. RSL can
  be posed as a sparsity-regularized multi-task regression problem. Standard methods,
  like group lasso, may not select important features if they are strongly correlated
  with others. To address this shortcoming we present a new regularizer for multitask
  regression called Group Ordered Weighted \ell_1 (GrOWL). Another key contribution
  of our paper is a novel application to fMRI brain imaging. Representational Similarity
  Analysis (RSA) is a tool for testing whether localized brain regions encode perceptual
  similarities. Using GrOWL, we propose a new approach called Network RSA that can
  discover arbitrarily structured brain networks (possibly widely distributed and
  non-local) that encode similarity information. We show, in theory and fMRI experiments,
  how GrOWL deals with strongly correlated covariates.
