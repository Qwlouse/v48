title: A Convex Atomic-Norm Approach to Multiple Sequence Alignment and Motif Discovery
abstract: Multiple Sequence Alignment and Motif Discovery, known as NP-hard problems,
  are two fundamental tasks in Bioinformatics. Existing approaches to these two problems
  are based on either local search methods such as Expectation Maximization (EM),
  Gibbs Sampling or greedy heuristic methods. In this work, we develop a convex relaxation
  approach to both problems based on the recent concept of atomic norm and develop
  a new algorithm, termed Greedy Direction Method of Multiplier, for solving the convex
  relaxation with two convex atomic constraints. Experiments show that our convex
  relaxation approach produces solutions of higher quality than those standard tools
  widely-used in Bioinformatics community on the Multiple Sequence Alignment and Motif
  Discovery problems.
