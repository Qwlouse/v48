title: False Discovery Rate Control and Statistical Quality Assessment of Annotators
  in Crowdsourced Ranking
abstract: With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and
  relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a
  short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators,
  some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially
  degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a
  statistical framework to model and detect annotator’s position bias in order to
  control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of
  biased annotators–the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries
  being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true
  and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters
  adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics
  whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data
  analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples
  and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively
  studying annotator’s abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing.
