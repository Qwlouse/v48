title: Black-box Optimization with a Politician
abstract: We propose a new framework for black-box convex optimization which is well-suited
  for situations where gradient computations are expensive. We derive a new method
  for this framework which leverages several concepts from convex optimization, from
  standard first-order methods (e.g. gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods) to
  analytical centers (i.e. minimizers of self-concordant barriers). We demonstrate
  empirically that our new technique compares favorably with state of the art algorithms
  (such as BFGS).
