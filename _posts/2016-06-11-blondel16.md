title: 'Polynomial Networks and Factorization Machines: New Insights and Efficient
  Training Algorithms'
abstract: Polynomial networks and factorization machines are two recently-proposed
  models that can efficiently use feature interactions in classification and regression
  tasks. In this paper, we revisit both models from a unified perspective. Based on
  this new view, we study the properties of both models and propose new efficient
  training algorithms. Key to our approach is to cast parameter learning as a low-rank
  symmetric tensor estimation problem, which we solve by multi-convex optimization.
  We demonstrate our approach on regression and recommender system tasks.
