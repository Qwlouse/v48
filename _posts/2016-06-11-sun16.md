title: Learning to Filter with Predictive State Inference Machines
abstract: Latent state space models are a fundamental and widely used tool for modeling
  dynamical systems. However, they are difficult to learn from data and learned models
  often lack performance guarantees on inference tasks such as filtering and prediction.
  In this work, we present the PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINE (PSIM), a data-driven
  method that considers the inference procedure on a dynamical system as a composition
  of predictors. The key idea is that rather than first learning a latent state space
  model, and then using the learned model for inference, PSIM directly learns predictors
  for inference in predictive state space. We provide theoretical guarantees for inference,
  in both realizable and agnostic settings, and showcase practical performance on
  a variety of simulated and real world robotics benchmarks.
