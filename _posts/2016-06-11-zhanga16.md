title: On the Consistency of Feature Selection With Lasso for Non-linear Targets
abstract: An important question in feature selection is whether a selection strategy
  recovers the “true” set of features, given enough data. We study this question in
  the context of the popular Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso)
  feature selection strategy. In particular, we consider the scenario when the model
  is misspecified so that the learned model is linear while the underlying real target
  is nonlinear. Surprisingly, we prove that under certain conditions, Lasso is still
  able to recover the correct features in this case. We also carry out numerical studies
  to empirically verify the theoretical results and explore the necessity of the conditions
  under which the proof holds.
