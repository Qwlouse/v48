title: Fast k-Nearest Neighbour Search via Dynamic Continuous Indexing
abstract: Existing methods for retrieving k-nearest neighbours suffer from the curse
  of dimensionality. We argue this is caused in part by inherent deficiencies of space
  partitioning, which is the underlying strategy used by most existing methods. We
  devise a new strategy that avoids partitioning the vector space and present a novel
  randomized algorithm that runs in time linear in dimensionality of the space and
  sub-linear in the intrinsic dimensionality and the size of the dataset and takes
  space constant in dimensionality of the space and linear in the size of the dataset.
  The proposed algorithm allows fine-grained control over accuracy and speed on a
  per-query basis, automatically adapts to variations in data density, supports dynamic
  updates to the dataset and is easy-to-implement. We show appealing theoretical properties
  and demonstrate empirically that the proposed algorithm outperforms locality-sensitivity
  hashing (LSH) in terms of approximation quality, speed and space efficiency.
