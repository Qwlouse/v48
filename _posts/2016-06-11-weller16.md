title: Uprooting and Rerooting Graphical Models
abstract: We show how any binary pairwise model may be “uprooted” to a fully symmetric
  model, wherein original singleton potentials are transformed to potentials on edges
  to an added variable, and then “rerooted” to a new model on the original number
  of variables. The new model is essentially equivalent to the original model, with
  the same partition function and allowing recovery of the original marginals or a
  MAP configuration, yet may have very different computational properties that allow
  much more efficient inference. This meta-approach deepens our understanding, may
  be applied to any existing algorithm to yield improved methods in practice, generalizes
  earlier theoretical results, and reveals a remarkable interpretation of the triplet-consistent
  polytope.
