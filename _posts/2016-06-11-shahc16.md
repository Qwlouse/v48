title: Pareto Frontier Learning with Expensive Correlated Objectives
abstract: There has been a surge of research interest in developing tools and analysis
  for Bayesian optimization, the task of finding the global maximizer of an unknown,
  expensive function through sequential evaluation using Bayesian decision theory.
  However, many interesting problems involve optimizing multiple, expensive to evaluate
  objectives simultaneously, and relatively little research has addressed this setting
  from a Bayesian theoretic standpoint. A prevailing choice when tackling this problem,
  is to model the multiple objectives as being independent, typically for ease of
  computation. In practice, objectives are correlated to some extent. In this work,
  we incorporate the modelling of inter-task correlations, developing an approximation
  to overcome intractable integrals. We illustrate the power of modelling dependencies
  between objectives on a range of synthetic and real world multi-objective optimization
  problems.
