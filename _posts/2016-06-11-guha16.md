title: Robust Random Cut Forest Based Anomaly Detection on Streams
abstract: In this paper we focus on the anomaly detection problem for dynamic data
  streams through the lens of random cut forests. We investigate a robust random cut
  data structure that can be used as a sketch or synopsis of the input stream. We
  provide a plausible definition of non-parametric anomalies based on the influence
  of an unseen point on the remainder of the data, i.e., the externality imposed by
  that point. We show how the sketch can be efficiently updated in a dynamic data
  stream. We demonstrate the viability of the algorithm on publicly available real
  data.
