title: The Label Complexity of Mixed-Initiative Classifier Training
abstract: Mixed-initiative classifier training, where the human teacher can choose
  which items to label or to label items chosen by the computer, has enjoyed empirical
  success but without a rigorous statistical learning theoretical justification. We
  analyze the label complexity of a simple mixed-initiative training mechanism using
  teach- ing dimension and active learning. We show that mixed-initiative training
  is advantageous com- pared to either computer-initiated (represented by active learning)
  or human-initiated classifier training. The advantage exists across all human teaching
  abilities, from optimal to completely unhelpful teachers. We further improve classifier
  training by educating the human teachers. This is done by showing, or explaining,
  optimal teaching sets to the human teachers. We conduct Mechanical Turk human experiments
  on two stylistic classifier training tasks to illustrate our approach.
