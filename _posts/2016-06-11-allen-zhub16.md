title: Improved SVRG for Non-Strongly-Convex or Sum-of-Non-Convex Objectives
abstract: 'Many classical algorithms are found until several years later to outlive
  the confines in which they were conceived, and continue to be relevant in unforeseen
  settings. In this paper, we show that SVRG is one such method: being originally
  designed for strongly convex objectives, it is also very robust in non-strongly
  convex or sum-of-non-convex settings. More precisely, we provide new analysis to
  improve the state-of-the-art running times in both settings by either applying SVRG
  or its novel variant. Since non-strongly convex objectives include important examples
  such as Lasso or logistic regression, and sum-of-non-convex objectives include famous
  examples such as stochastic PCA and is even believed to be related to training deep
  neural nets, our results also imply better performances in these applications.'
