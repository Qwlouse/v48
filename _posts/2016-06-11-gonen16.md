title: Solving Ridge Regression using Sketched Preconditioned SVRG
abstract: We develop a novel preconditioning method for ridge regression, based on
  recent linear sketching methods. By equipping Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient
  (SVRG) with this preconditioning process, we obtain a significant speed-up relative
  to fast stochastic methods such as SVRG, SDCA and SAG.
