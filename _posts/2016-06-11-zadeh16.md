title: Geometric Mean Metric Learning
abstract: 'We revisit the task of learning a Euclidean metric from data. We approach
  this problem from first principles and formulate it as a surprisingly simple optimization
  problem. Indeed, our formulation even admits a closed form solution. This solution
  possesses several very attractive properties: (i) an innate geometric appeal through
  the Riemannian geometry of positive definite matrices; (ii) ease of interpretability;
  and (iii) computational speed several orders of magnitude faster than the widely
  used LMNN and ITML methods. Furthermore, on standard benchmark datasets, our closed-form
  solution consistently attains higher classification accuracy.'
