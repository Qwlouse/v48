title: 'Stochastically Transitive Models for Pairwise Comparisons: Statistical and
  Computational Issues'
abstract: There are various parametric models for analyzing pairwise comparison data,
  including the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, but their reliance
  on strong parametric assumptions is limiting. In this work, we study a flexible
  model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required
  only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes parametric
  models including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably
  more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically
  transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite
  this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated
  at the same rate as in standard parametric models. On the other hand, unlike in
  the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the minimax-optimal estimator in the stochastically
  transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable
  alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically
  consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms
  that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically
  transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical
  simulations.
