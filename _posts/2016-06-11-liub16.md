title: A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests
abstract: We derive a new discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between
  two probability distributions based on combining Steinâ€™s identity and the reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space theory. We apply our result to test how well a probabilistic
  model fits a set of observations, and derive a new class of powerful goodness-of-fit
  tests that are widely applicable for complex and high dimensional distributions,
  even for those with computationally intractable normalization constants. Both theoretical
  and empirical properties of our methods are studied thoroughly.
